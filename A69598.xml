            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE AUTHOR to the READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE kind reception the former Part of this Diſcourſe found in the World hath drawn forth this Second, which had otherwiſe expired in as much Secreſie as it was written. Nor am I concern'd for the future fate of either of them.</p>
                  <p>But if I might be ſo happy as to diſcover the Errors of thoſe courſes which have brought theſe three Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Kingdoms, and this moſt Excellent Church into a diſ-eſteem abroad, and great danger at home, and ſo might contribute in the leaſt to the prevention of thoſe Miſchiefs that in time may hazzard the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of them, I ſhould then account my ſelf bleſſed, and my undertaking proſperous, what ever effect it might happen to have upon my private Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>Next the Preſervation of the publick Peace of any People, the Advancing <hi>Trade and Commerce,</hi> and the Effects, of theſe, Wealth and Power; Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Conveniences of humane Life, are chiefly to be reguarded; and if I can ſhew that the contrary
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:56751:3"/>of all theſe will attend the proceeding any further in our late Methods, I ſhall not queſtion, but all that have any kindneſs for themſelves will ſee that it is their Intereſt to deſert them.</p>
                  <p>Commerce and Trade ſpring Naturally from Peace and Setled Governments; and are cheriſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the mutual Truſt and Confidence, Love and Kindneſs which Men have in, and to each other; and where theſe fail, there is a ſtop, and ſometimes a total ruine of the former.</p>
                  <p>A very ſmall reflection on the Inconveniences that do attend a War of any Kind, will ſatisfie a perſon of mean Capacity, That Trade will ſtand ſtill when the Sword is in Motion, for Men will not care to venture their Eſtates or Perſons abroad, when they may juſtly expect to fall into the Hands of Soldiers, who purchaſe the richeſt Commodities with their Swords, and pay off the Traders with ready Blows inſtead of Mony.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Effect though not ſo viſibly, muſt attend any Government that reels and ſtaggers, and ſeems every day likely (by violence) to be changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for who would imploy his Time, Stock, and Thoughts, to encreaſe that Wealth, which a Stranger, and it may be his Mortal Enemy, may raviſh from him in a moment, after many years toyl and labour to acquire it?</p>
                  <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:56751:3"/>
                  <p>Beſides, it is not unuſual for Merchants (who are quick ſighted) when they perceive a Storm to hang over any People, to take Care betimes to lodge their Fortunes, or a conſiderable part of them, in places that are better ſecur'd; the Conſequence of which is, that not only what was imported is waſted, but much that might have been brought in is diverted, and the Neighbour Nations are by that means En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, whilſt the Miſerable People languiſh and feel one of the worſt Effects of War, <hi>Want,</hi> even in the time of a ſuſpicious Unſetled Peace.</p>
                  <p>But this (though bad enough) is not all, the richeſt Men in ſuch Countries, who have any Conſiderable quantities of Treaſure will be likely too, to ſecure as much as they can well ſpare abroad; not knowing how ſoon that which they have by them may fall into other Hands, who will give them but ſmall thanks for it; and it may be, deſtroy them as they do <hi>Bees</hi> towards Winter, that they may rifle the Hive with the greater Security. Thus will much more be Exported that might better have been Kept at Home, and the Wealth of the Nation be inſenſibly Waſted.</p>
                  <p>And without either of theſe, the diſtruſts and fears of men amongſt themſelves will leſſen their Induſtry, and make them court even Poverty it ſelf, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth more Security than an Inviduous Fortune.</p>
                  <p>But if this Effect be not uſual, eſpecially when
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:56751:4"/>Dangers are at a diſtance; yet I ſuppoſe few men are ſo ignorant as not to have obſerved, that ſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Governments have endeavoured to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Poverty of their People, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eaſieſt Govern'd, when like a Ship they are not over-loaden with the weight of too much Wealth; and this muſt of neceſſity have a miſchievous Effect upon any People, when their Governours contrive their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhment, and promote it in ſuch ways, that they ſhall feel the Effect, and yet never ſee the Cauſe; it is true, we have had nothing of this yet, but who knows how ſoon we may, if we go on ſtill to provoke it.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh I could as truly ſay, that the Trade and Commerce of theſe Countries have not deſignedly been diminiſhed and impaired by them who are oppoſite to the Eſtabliſht Government, with intention to render it uneaſie and hated, and the People diſcontented and ungovernable: but the truth is, there have many things been done of late years, or omitted when they might have been done, which I believe no Mortal can give any ſound reaſon for, if this were not at the bottom; and this hath, and will have the ſame Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us, as if thoſe that are properly called our Governours had done it.</p>
                  <p>But not to drive this any further, It is a known Method of promoting broyls in Governments, to ſtop the Supplies that ſhould preſerve and maintain them;
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:56751:4"/>and then if a People be really very rich, yet if the Government that ſhould preſerve their Wealth be ſo poor as not to be able to protect them, the People have been always in danger, and ſometimes actually ruin'd. Thus was <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr brought to yield ſo much, that at laſt he was forc'd to defend the reſt, and himſelf with his Sword; which beſides all the Blood ſhed, occaſioned the Expence of a vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and went very near to the ruine of theſe Three Nations. I ſhall not need to determine how far this Courſe hath been of late purſu'd; but I ſay it tends to the ruine of our Trade and Commerce, by the ſame degrees as it makes our Government weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the World.</p>
                  <p>When the dangers to any Government have ariſen from Contending Parties or Factions within it ſelf, nothing is more uſual then for thoſe Parties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the impoveriſhing of each other by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting, diverting, and hindring each others Trades; and refuſing each to other the Aid and Aſſiſtance that is abſolutely neceſſary for the promoting them; and that this is every day done among us, is too apparent to be denyed; and the Effects this hath upon the whole Trade of the Nation are ſuch, as no man can pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate to the bottom of them, or tell where the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief will end.</p>
                  <p>That I may make theſe general Reflections more
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:56751:5"/>uſeful to my Country-men, I will take a ſhort view of the ſtate of the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory.</p>
                  <p>The State of <hi>England</hi> was then very low, and its Condition Deplorable, when God brought that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince from the Miſeries of a Priſon to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Reſtore it; I cannot poſſibly better repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this than in the Words of <hi>Camden:</hi> 
                     <q rend="margSglQuotes">The <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was moſt miſerable at that time, as being involved in a War with <hi>Scotland</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>France</hi> on the other; oppreſſed with the Debts which <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth had Contracted; the Exchequer was Exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; <hi>Calis</hi> and the County of <hi>Oyen,</hi> and in them a great Magazine, were loſt to the diſhonour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name; and the People were divided in their Opinions concerning Religion. The Queen had no Potent Friends, nor was fortified with the<note n="*" place="margin">Cognatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance (or Kindred) of any Foreign Princes.</q> The Trade of <hi>England</hi> muſt of neceſſity be very ſmall when the Nation was thus Near ruine.</p>
                  <p>But when the Queen had once ſetled the buſineſs of Religion; and afterwards had taken care to preſerve it from Foreign Violence, by Repairing her Navy Royal, ſo that it was far Superiour to any other; which gave her Reputation at home, and Fame
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:56751:5"/>abroad; and alſo from the Attempts of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Diſſenters</hi> by ſevere Laws, conſtantly put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and had thereby Won the Affections of her People, and ſtilled their Fears: They being ſecur'd thus at home, began to ſearch all the corners of the World for <hi>Trade,</hi> and ſent forth their Fleets to the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> (by the <hi>Bay</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> by them Diſcover'd,) and <hi>Green-Land,</hi> and indeed, whether not? whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with Honour and Wealth, and made her and themſelves Happy.</p>
                  <p>One thing that gave a great Advantage to the Trade, and conſequently to the Wealth of <hi>England,</hi> in her time, was the Devaſtations which the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> and the Wars of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> thereby occaſion'd, cauſed in thoſe Countries; by which means we gained ſome Addition to our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the knowledge of ſome Manufactures, which we had not before; and alſo a vaſt ſtock of Mony and Treaſure, which altogether had like to have totally ruin'd the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> but however this concurring with the reſt, helped to advance <hi>England</hi> to that height of Wealth, and Reputation in the World, that it was in her days the Bulwark of Chriſtendom; and without any conſiderable forrein Aſſiſtance hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and brought down the <hi>Houſe of Auſtria,</hi> which then aimed at an Univerſal Monarchy.</p>
                  <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:56751:6"/>
                  <p>But then it cannot be denyed, that together with theſe <hi>Low Countrymen.</hi> Factions and Common-Weath Principles entred <hi>England:</hi> And although the ſeverity of that Queen, and the great Affection and Veneration the People had for her, added to her Conſtancy whoſe Motto was <hi>Semper eadem,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, kept them both under, ſo as they were never able to give her any conſiderable diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; yet they grew and encreaſed, and in the Reign of her Succeſſor tugged ſtoutly in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for the Victory with the <hi>Court</hi> Party, as they then ſtiled all that ſtood to the Crown, and kept King <hi>James</hi> at Bay, and deſtitute of thoſe Supplies that were neceſſary to preſerve the Grandeur of the Crown, and the Reputation of <hi>England;</hi> and forced him to ſpend Seven Years of his Reign without calling any Parliaments; and the laſt he called, which was in his One and Twentieth Year, involved him in War. And the next, baſely Betray'd his Son, who ſucceeded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, to the Neceſſity of clapping up a Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Peace for want of Means to carry on a War.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown, the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>England</hi> expected a mighty advantage by it, becauſe <hi>Scotland</hi> had been always <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (from whence he came) during his time, and they hoped his Education might have ſtrongly influenced him to favour them, above the Religion Eſtabliſhed; and
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:56751:6"/>upon this intuition,<note place="margin">

<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:56751:7"/>
                        <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-land</hi> Trade, the Company of which heretofore was above all others the moſt flouriſhing, and by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt was termed the Royal Company; for it ſupplied <hi>Muſcovy, Sweden, Denmark, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Lifeland,</hi> with our Woollen Manufactures, and made very advantagious Returns by Treaſure (eſpecially <hi>Hungaria Duckets</hi>) and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of thoſe Countries, into <hi>England.</hi> This Trade till King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſolely injoyed. About the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, the <hi>Dutch</hi> began to be Interlopers rather than Traders with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in it, but in the time of the Wars, by the aforeſaid means, the <hi>Dutch</hi> allmoſt totally excluded the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </q> We may obſerve how much the Trade of the Nation in general ſuffered by all this and eſpecially that of <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> of which the ſaid Author gives an inſtance, pag. <hi>33.</hi> and from thence we may conclude how far the Trade of the Nation hath been, and conſequently may again be, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by Factions, if they be encouraged ſtill amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>I ought not to paſs over in ſilence, that my laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Author, Aſcribes this to the ſevere injunctions of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, which theſe Zealous people would not indure. And I know that many have uſed
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:56751:8"/>this as an Argument againſt Perſecution, and for a Toleration, Comprehenſion, or (as the new Name is) an Union But I reply, if there were no Factions there could be no Perſecution, as they ſtile it, nor any ſuch dammage of our Trade and Commerce. Secondly, that they were not thus perſecuted till they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked that King to the uttermoſt by rendring all Parliaments dangerous to the Crown, and brought things into that State, that neither the Monarchy nor the Religion Eſtabliſhed could be any longer preſerved without that ſeverity. So we may ſee if they be treated gently they grow Numerous, and endeavour to ſubvert the Government; if they be dealt ſeverely with, they over into forreign Countries and deſtroy our Trade; ſo that both waies our ruine is almost aſſured by them, and therefore ſhould be no more incouraged than Pyrates and the common enemies of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>I Conſider, That I am Writing a Preface to a ſmall Book, and therefore endeavour to be ſhort; and for ought I know, may be dark: but if all this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on, as it ought, it will be a wonder not that our Trade is ſo little, but that it is not totally Ruin'd.</p>
                  <p>But then my dear Countrymen, may not Heaven and Earth ſtand amazed at our Stupidity and folly, if we ſhall ſtill go on ſtubbornly in thoſe very ways which we have found ſo deſtructive to us: but there is a greater wonder in it yet; we ſtabb and wound our own Vitals (our Trade and Commerce,) and at the ſame time, pretend we are horribly afraid others ſhould ruin us many years hence; we careſs and cheriſh theſe very Men and Factions, that once before Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed us to almoſt Beggery, we are hard at Work to ruine that Government, by making it odious to the People, under which <hi>England</hi> hath flouriſhed in Wealth and Power, in Reputation and Peace at home and abroad ſo many Ages, and to ſet up one in the ſtead of it, which within the memory of Man, ſo narrowly miſſed of Ruining us forever.

                  </p>
                  <p>But though Men may Conſider theſe things as much, or as little as they pleaſe, yet I crave the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to Conclude upon the whole, That whoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes Factions in Church or State, is an Enemy to Trade and Commerce, and that when ever the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this, or any other Country is indangered, the Traffick of that place will ſuffer proportionably; ſo that let them pretend what they will to the contrary, they that promote our preſent Diſturbances are as great Enemies to the Free-men and Free-holders of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all that are any way concerned in Trade, as they are either to the Crown or the Church.</p>

                     <p>The Diſſenters in the interim, who had with much impatience expected this day of Deliverance from this terrible Parliament, and had ſought the Diſſolution of it ſo many Years, by all thoſe Arts I have deſcribed in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56751:16"/>the former Part now began to lift up their heads, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to have another tugg for the Day, and having before wrought upon the meaneſt but moſt Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous part of the <hi>Free-men</hi> and <hi>Free-holders,</hi> and the weakeſt of the Gentry, by jading their Ears with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious canting Diſcourſes againſt Humane Inſtitutions, Perſecuting Gods People, and Arbritrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and now of late, with Tragical Repreſentations of the Popiſh Plot, Maſſacres, Popery, and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; flew from their ſullen retirements, and Riding Night and Day about the Villages, and trudging about the Corporations, incited thoſe they found willing, and perſwaded, intreated, and ſometimes hired thoſe they found leſs diſpoſed to joyn with them, and by the choice of a ſober Proteſtant Parliament, (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) to deliver the Nation from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government,</hi> which were good Words, but had a Knaviſh ſignification in their Senſe, and if any Man ſmelt ir out, and told them truly, they were neither for <hi>Popery</hi> nor <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> nor yet for <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſm</hi> and a <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> they ran him down with noiſe, or traduced him behind his back to their Neighbours as a <hi>Papiſt</hi> in Maſquerade, and a Man of <hi>Arbitrary Principles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if a Man had but chanced to drop a Word by way of queſtioning the Truth of one Tittle the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Informers had given out concerning the <hi>Plot,</hi> or theſe Zealots had raiſed by way of Conſequence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they flew in his face, and villified him as a defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Kings Evidence, a concealer of the <hi>Plot;</hi> and could hardly forbear ſaying, He was a Party to it, and one of the Conſpirators in it. As if we had not only been bound to ſubmit our Faith and Reaſon as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to Mr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s Relation in every <hi>Punctilio,</hi> as to the Evangeliſts upon which he Swore it; but alſo to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56751:16"/>what Inferences a Faction ſhould draw from it. From hence they proceeded to inſinuate into the Populace, That thoſe Loyal Gentlemen who had been Members of the late long Loyal Parliament, who were then call'd the <hi>Court Party,</hi> had joyn'd with the Court, to hinder the Diſcovery of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and promote the Deſignes of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> upon us: And although there was not one ſyllable of Truth in this, yet they aſſerted it with that confidence, and added ſo many proteſtations, often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting their oppoſites with ſuch queſtions as theſe, What, you are for <hi>Popery?</hi> you are willing to have all your Throats Cut? and the like, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded too great a Number to joyn with them in the Excluſion of thoſe Gentlemen.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, fearing the greateſt hindrance from the conformable Clergy and the Biſhops, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them amongſt their Confidents as nothing better than the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and amongſt the reſt, as Men that had a mighty kindneſs for <hi>Popery</hi> in their hearts, (where theſe prying people ſpied it) though they durſt not diſcover it for the preſent, and with great Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſaid, that they would certainly all turn <hi>Papiſts</hi> if the <hi>Plot</hi> went on; though Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had aſſured them their Places were diſpoſed of to others before hand, and they muſt expect nothing but beggery, aſſaſſination, and Ruine: But yet the people who never conſider any thing, believe them in this too.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, they were to deal with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Magiſtrates, and here the task was harder, for theſe were never to be wrought over generally to them; but amongſt them, ſome were their friends of old, others had come half way over to gain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Moderate Men; others had been diſguſted by the Government; and ſome few had Relations amongſt the Diſſenters, or Children, and Brothers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56751:17"/>Apprentices, Journey-men, and Factors to them, and theſe Intereſts prevail'd upon to joyn with them; the reſt they blaſted what they could by the ſame Arts they did the Clergy, averring they were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> eſpecially, if they had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of that Religion; or had ſhewed the leaſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Neighbours in the firſt Diſcovery of the Plot, or had had any acquaintance with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Plot.</p>
                     <p>And having by all theſe multiply'd Slanders, got over a very conſiderable part of the meaner people, and yet fearing the party might be too weak, they made fraudulent Conveyances for Twenty four hours of their Freehold-Lands and Tenements to their Neighbours, by this means creating Twenty Muſhrom Voters, ſometimes out of Forty pounds a year, and ſome that were leſs ſcrupulous took the Gifts by word of Mouth, without Livery or Seizin, Leaſe or Releaſe; and ſome gave Twelve pence in part of payment for thoſe Lands and Tenements they never meant, nor were ever able to Purchaſe further, and ſo became qualified to give their Votes as they thought; and others gave their Children that were Infants part of their Eſtates with them, and brought them along for company; and in the interim, the Wealthy ſort of Men hired Horſes, or gave Mony to the more Needy to give their Votes for the precious Men that were to keep out <hi>Popery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Conventicle Teachers rallied up their Flocks, all but the Aprons, and they were unwillingly enough left at home; The old Committee Men, Sequeſtrators; Army Officers, and Soldiers of the laſt Rebellion; who had kept holes ever ſince His Majeſties Return for Grief, Confuſion, and Fear, now all took the Field again to Vote too: and with theſe joyned all thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56751:17"/>unwilling Conformiſts whether Clergy or Layety who have complyed with the Religion Eſtabliſhed, with purpoſe to ruine it as ſoon as it is poſſible, and in the interim, great gain is godlineſs with them: and does any man believe all theſe Forces were thus Muſtered up for the Service of His Majeſty, the Safety of the Monarchy, and the preſervation of the Religion and Government Eſtabliſh'd?</p>
                     <p>The perſons they recommended to the people to be choſen again, were firſt, all thoſe Gentlemen, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves the <hi>Country Party</hi> in the former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had appeared moſt Zealouſly againſt the Queen, his Royal Highneſs, and the Miniſters of State: to theſe they added as many as they could of the Reliques of the old Rebellion, or their Children, and made up the Number out of the moderate and diſcontented Gentlemen, Burgeſſes, and Trades-men, taking in here and there an honeſt Gentleman in hopes to win him to their ſide by this kindneſs; and ſometimes this pittiful Project took.</p>
                     <p>For my part,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>22.</hi>
                        </note> I think nothing could more confirm the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> who informs us, <q rend="margSglQuotes">
                           <hi>That</hi> the Catholick Religion was to be brought in the ſame way that they had uſed for the Deſtruction of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King, and as that could not be effected till much Blood was ſpilt on BOTH SIDES, ſo this muſt be effected by effuſion of Blood,<note place="margin">Pag. <hi>64.</hi>
                           </note> and this he Expounds was to be done by weakning and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Civil Wars and Rebellions, as in His (Majeſties) Fathers time, to make way for the <hi>French</hi> to Seize theſe Kingdoms, and totally to Ruine their Infantry and Naval Force:</q> Theſe are Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> his Words, and whoever had ſeen the perſons Muſt'red up, about the chooſing this Parliament, would have thought, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56751:18"/>
                        <hi>Forty One</hi> had been returned again, and that the Jeſuits under the ſhape of Nonconformiſt Miniſters had been turning the <hi>Plot</hi> that way, now God had defeated the cloſe one.</p>
                     <p>But though all this Care was taken, the Diſſenters did not carry the Elections every where, nor almoſt any where without great Reſiſtance. For on the other ſide, the Gentry appeared themſelves, and brought in their Tenants and Dependences; and many of the Yeomanry and Free-holders were Zealous for the Church and Government, and in Corporations, the Magiſtrates and Free-men, had not forgot the old tricks of the Diſſenters; and were reſolved not to be ruin'd twice by the ſame Arts, ſo that the two Parties were almoſt equal there, and in the Counties the Gentry were certainly the ſtronger ſide, if Perjury had not been employed againſt them; and in ſome places they prevailed againſt that too, but not ſo as to make an equal Party in the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>The Perſons that ſtood on this ſide, were Men of Undoubted Loyalty to the King, hearty lovers of the Religion Eſtabliſhed, and great Enemies to Puritaniſm, Faction, and Rebellion; and for theſe good qualities were ſtiled by the contrary Party-men of <hi>Arbitrary Principles,</hi> and favourers of <hi>Popery:</hi> ſome of theſe had been Members of the Laſt Parliament, and been of that they call the <hi>Court Party,</hi> who had been guilty of Setling the Monarchy, and Suppreſſing the Rebellion, and the Nurſeries of it the Conventicles; and others were taken in to fill up the vacancies, of or very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the ſame Principles.</p>
                     <p>The Elections being thus made, the Parliament met the day appointed, which was Thurſday the ſixth of <hi>March,</hi> 1678. and my buſineſs is to wait upon them, and ſee how matters went in the Lower Houſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56751:18"/>and as an Introduction I will take notice of His Majeſty's Speech in the firſt place; part of which was as followeth.</p>

                           <p>I Meet you here with the moſt earneſt deſire that man can have to Unite the Minds of all my Subjects, both to me, and to one another; and I reſolve it ſhall be your faults, if the Succeſs be not ſuitable to my deſires, I have done many great things already, in order to that end; as the Excluſion of the Popiſh Lords from their Seats in Parliament; the Execution of ſeveral men, both upon the Score of the <hi>Plat,</hi> and of the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmonberry Godfrey,</hi> and it is apparent that I have not been idle in proſecuting the diſcovery of both, as much further as hath been poſſible in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                           <p>I have disbanded as much of the Army as I could get Mony to do, and I am ready to disband the reſt, ſo ſoon as you ſhall reimburſe the Mony they have coſt me, and will inable me to pay off the remainder: And above all I have Commanded my Brother to abſent himſelf from me, becauſe I would not leave the Malicious Men room to ſay, I had not removed all cauſes which could be pretended to influence me towards Popiſh Counſels.</p>
                           <p>Beſides that end of Union which I am at, (and which I wiſh could be extended to Proteſtants abroad as well as at home) I propoſe by this laſt great ſtep I have made, to diſcern whether Proteſtant Religion, and the Peace of the Kingdom be as truly aimed at by others, as they are really intended by me, for if they be, you will imploy your time upon the great concerns of the Nation, and not be drawn to promote private animoſities under pretences of the publique;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56751:19"/>your Proceedings will be calm and peaceable, in order to thoſe good ends I have recommended to you, and you will curb the motions of any unruly Spirits which would endeavour to diſturb them.

                           <p>I ſhall not ceaſe my endeavours, dayly to find out what more I can both of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and Murder of Sir <hi>Edmondberry Godfrey,</hi> and ſhall deſire the Aſſiſtance of both my Houſes in that work.</p>
                           <p>I have not been wanting in giving orders for putting all the preſent Laws in Execution againſt Papiſts, and I am ready to joyn in the making ſuch further Laws as may be neceſſary for ſecuring of the Kingdom againſt Popery.</p>

                     <p>By which laſt paſſage I believe his Majeſty reflected upon the Diſſenters and Common wealth Party, who as they were more believed, ſo they had been more buſie in traducing him, and that with a more Miſchievous Malice and effect than the worſt Jeſuits, during this ſhort time, betwixt the Diſſolution of the laſt and the Election of this preſent Parliament, and therefore his Majeſty had reaſon to tell the Parliament he expected
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56751:19"/>to be defended by them from the Calumny, (of the Diſſenters) as well as from the danger of the Papiſts, (both which are) the worſt of men, as who did endeavour to render him and his Government Odious to his people.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Chancellor's Speech was for the moſt part but an enlargement upon his Majeſtie's, as it uſes to be; and therefore I ſhall take notice of ſome paſſages only in it.</p>
                     <q rend="margSglQuotes">
                        <p>He adviſed them not to overdo their buſineſs, and by being too far tranſported with the fears of Popery, neglect the opportunities they then had of making ſober and laſting proviſions againſt it.</p>
                        <p>He told them it was a Cuſtom of the Jeſuits, firſt to Murder the fame of Princes, and then their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, firſt ſlandering them to their people, as if they favoured Papiſts, and then to aſſaſſinate them for being too Zealous Proteſtants.</p>
                        <p>He repreſented what a joy it would be to them, to ſee us whom they could not deſtroy by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, Ruining our ſelves after the diſcovery, by incurable jealouſies and diſturbing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>And that further care might be taken of Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Preſs, from whence there daily ſtole forth Popiſh <hi>Catechiſms, Pſalters,</hi> and Books of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and Seditious and Schiſmatical Libells too.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>We ſhall now ſee how theſe Counſells were purſued by the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing the Houſe of Commons did, was to chooſe <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> Eſquire, their former Speaker, their Speaker again. But the next day the King diſliking the choice, and Commanding them to make a new one, they returned and Adjourned till <hi>Saturday</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56751:20"/>Morning. But not agreeing then, they deſired a further time; which was granted till <hi>Tueſday</hi> following: The King telling the Meſſengers, <hi>that</hi> as he would not have his Prerogative intrencht upon, <hi>ſo</hi> he would not do any thing againſt the Priviledges of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>But then inſtead of Preſenting a new Speaker, they Preſented a Repreſentation, Claiming it as a Right to have that Speaker they choſe accepted, if he were not excuſed for ſome Corporal Diſeaſe, which hath always (heretofore) been alleadged either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or ſome others, in their behalf in full Parliament, as they ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But his Majeſty not admitting this neither, they Adjourned till <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and drew up another Addreſs to have the former better conſidered, and to this his Majeſty replied he would ſend them an anſwer the next day. And accordingly,</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> he ſent for them up to the Houſe of Lords, and Prorogued them for one day, and on <hi>Saturday</hi> morning ſent for them again, and by the Lord Chancellor Commanded them to proceed to the Choice of a Speaker, and Preſent him on <hi>Munday</hi> Morning; which they accordingly did; and then they choſe Mr. <hi>Sergeant Gregory,</hi> of whom his Majeſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved on the <hi>Monday</hi> following.</p>
                     <p>It was Ominous thus to ſtumble at the Threſhold; and therefore there is no great wonder if after this, much of his Majeſties and the Lord Chancellors good Counſell relating to calmneſs in the Management of their Affairs was forgotten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tueſday, Wedneſday,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>20th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> being ſpent in the preliminaries, and in receiving and reading the ſhoal of Petitions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning undue Elections and Returns, on the Evening
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56751:20"/>of the laſt day, the Commons ſent a Meſſage to the Lords to put them in mind of the Impeachments of High Treaſon againſt <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> in the names of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and to deſire he might be Committed to ſafe Cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>And referred it to the Committee of Secrecy to draw up further Articles againſt him. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that they were reſolved to begin where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parliament ended; ſo that men eaſily conjectured what would follow. And ſome there were that ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if his place was his greateſt Crime, and that the ruin of a Miniſter of State in order to fright the reſt of the Miniſters was more ſought, than the Puniſhment of any Traytor whether Popiſh or Proteſtant.</p>
                     <p>In the week following it appearing that the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> had a pardon by his Majeſties mentioning of it in the Houſe of Lords. And a Committee being appointed to ſearch it out, returned on <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> that it had not been Regularly ſued out, but was Sealed in the King's preſence by his expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Upon which the Commons ſent up a Meſſage to the Lords to demand Juſtice againſt him, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Addreſs to his Majeſty to repreſent the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequences of granting Pardons to any perſons that lie under an Impeachment of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>And the ſame day the Lords ſent word to the Commons that they had ordered him to be taken into Cuſtody.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1679.</note> the Lords ſent a Meſſage to the Commons, that the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> was not to be ſound, upon which the Commons ordered a Bill to be brought in to Summon him by a certain day, or in default thereof to Attaint him.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56751:21"/>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Edward Sacvile</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons, being accuſed by Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> to have called the truth of the Plot and Murder of Sir <hi>Edmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry Godfrey</hi> in queſtion was ordered to be committed to the Tower, Expelled the Houſe, and an Addreſs made to his Majeſty for the removing him from all Publick Imployments and Truſts. This was a ſure way to have the Plot believed.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> there having before been a Complaint brought againſt one <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Edwin,</hi> for Printing a Pamphlet intituled, A Letter from a Jeſuite at <hi>Paris</hi> to his Correpondent in <hi>London:</hi> Shewing the moſt effectual way to ruin the Government and the Proteſtant Religion; was to promote the Diſſenters Intereſt, and to chuſe factious men into the Houſe of Commons. And it appearing, that Dr. <hi>John Nalſon</hi> was the Author of it, there being no Law to puniſh this offence, the ſaid Doctor was ordered to be ſent for in Cuſtody of the Serjeant at Arms, to inform the Houſe touching the ſaid Pamphlet.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day a Bill was ſent down from the Lords, Intituled, an Act for the better diſcovery and ſpeedy Conviction of Popiſh Recuſants. Which had been ſent down in the former Seſſion of Parliament time enough to have been paſſed, but was neglected, which was read the day following.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Lords ſent down a Bill for the Baniſhing and Diſabling the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> (which his Majeſty had profered to do) and deſired the Concurrence of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which the Commons read and rejected that day.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding the Commons went on with the Bill of Attainder againſt him, and ordered a Clauſe to be added for the diſcovery of all truſts relating to him, and that he ſhould be made incapable of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56751:21"/>receiving pardon but by Act of Parliament, wherein he ſhall be particularly Named.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Lords ſent down a Bill to diſinable any perſon from Sitting in any of the Houſes of Convocation, till he hath taken the Oaths, and made and ſubſcribed the Declaration therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday,</hi> a Bill was read for better ſecuring the liberty of the Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Calthrop</hi> Knight, who was returned one of the Knights of the Shire for <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being then ſick of the <hi>Small-pox,</hi> deſired that the Caſe in difference betwixt him and Sir <hi>John Hobard</hi> Baronet, which was to be heard on <hi>Friday</hi> next, might be delayed, which was denyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That <hi>Calthrop</hi> was of the Court-party, and <hi>Hobard</hi> of the Country-party.</p>
                     <p>But to look a little back: On <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> the Houſe of Lords ſent to examin the five Lords in the Tower, concerning a <hi>French</hi> Book about the Plot, the Author of which had it ſeems endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to invalidate Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> his teſtimony, but they would not own they knew the Author.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Vote mentioned in the former Part, of the reality of the Popiſh Plot, which had been renewed by the Commons, and ſent up to the Lords for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, was Voted by the Lords, and ordered to be inſerted in the firſt leaf of the Office, to be publickly uſed on the day<note n="*" place="margin">11 <hi>of</hi> April.</note> appointed by his Majeſty for ſolemn Faſting and Humiliation, at the requeſt of both Houſes.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>29th,</hi> the Lords agreed to have a Bill brought in to expell out of the Inns of Court, <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> the College of Phyſicians, and Heralds office, all ſuch perſons as ſhall not give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56751:22"/>of their being Proteſtants, by going to Church, and by taking the Sacrament, and ſuch Oaths, Teſts, and Declarations as are appointed by any Law, for the diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inguiſhing Proteſtants from Papiſts, and that none ſhall hereafter be Admitted into any of the ſaid Societies, that ſhall not do the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And that an Addreſs ſhould be made to his Majeſty, that all perſons who bring up, or ſuffer their Children to be bred up, in the Popiſh Religion, may by his Majeſties order be put out of all publick Employments, civil, and military, whereof they are now poſſeſſed; AND that for the future no perſon may be put into or continued in any employment, civil or military, who ſhall knowingly Marry a Papiſt. Theſe laſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are moſt worthy to be paſſed into an Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> the Commons finiſhed the Bill of Attainder againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and ſent it up to the Lords.</p>
                     <p>After which they paſſed this Vote.</p>
                     <p>Reſolved, <hi>That the continuing of any ſtanding Forces in this Nation, other than the Militia, is illegal and a great Grievance and Vexation to the people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the firſt Vote that was ever made againſt his Majeſties Guards ſince his return, tho there have been Parliaments ſitting ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> the Articles of Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Powys, William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour, William</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Bellaſyſe,</hi> were brought into the Houſe of Commons, and received.</p>
                     <p>And a Bill about the Convocation ſent down by the Lords, and another to Regulate the Elections of Members to ſerve in Parliament, were read the firſt time, and ordered a ſecond Reading.</p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56751:22"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> An Act for the better diſcovery and more ſpeedy Conviction of Popiſh Recuſants, ſent down from the Lords, was read the ſecond time, and Committed to a Committee, who were alſo to bring in a Clauſe to prevent any of the Royal Family from matching with Popiſh Recuſants.</p>
                     <p>Was not this that tacking of things of a different Nature together, which his Majeſty had reſolved againſt, as he told the Houſes in theſe words about a year before?</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="margSglQuotes">One thing more I have to add, and that is,<note place="margin">His Majeſties Speech the <hi>23</hi> of <hi>May, 1678.</hi>
                           </note> to let you know, that I will never more ſuffer the courſe and method of paſſing Laws to be changed; and that if ſeveral matters ſhall ever again be tacked together in one Bill, that Bill ſhall certainly be loſt, let the importance of it be never ſo great.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it was reſolved it ſeems now to try whether he would be as good as his word, and if he were, then the clamour ſhould be, that he was againſt the ſpeedy conviction of Popiſh recuſants.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this was no ſuch trivial thing but that it might have deſerved a diſtinct Bill.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> being delivered back by the Lords at a Conference with ſome Amendments, the Commons referr'd the conſideration of the Amendments to be conſidered the next day, and ordered an Addreſs to be drawn up, for a Proclemation for the Apprehending the ſaid Earl, with the uſual penalties upon ſuch as conceal him, and that he ſhould not be permitted to reſide with in any of his Majeſties places of <hi>White-Hall, Somerſet Houſe,</hi> and St. <hi>James's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the Bill for Regulating Elections was read the ſecond time, and Committed to a Committee,<note place="margin">5 <hi>of</hi> April.</note> with liberty to divide the Bill as they ſee cauſe.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56751:23"/>
                     <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> his Majeſty by Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> acquainted the Houſe of Commons, that Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> had acquainted him by a letter directed to one Mr. <hi>Chiffinch,</hi> that he had matters of great importance concerning the Priſoners in the Tower, and the preſent Plot; but that his Majeſty would not meddle with any Priſoners Committed by this Houſe, and that he would (if the Houſe thought fit) not only permit him but lay his Commands on him frankly and freely to impart whatſoever he knew of that affair to the Houſe of Commons, or the Committee of Secrecy appointed by them. Which ſo pleaſed the Commons, that they ordered the humble thanks of the Houſe to be returned to his Majeſty; So far was he from concealing any thing relating to the Plot, as he hath been baſely and falſely calumniated.</p>
                     <p>This day the Commons ſent up the Articles againſt the five Lords in the Tower, into the Houſe of Lords.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day it was ordered that a Bill ſhould be brought in for Annexing <hi>Tangier</hi> to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">☞</note> upon a report that it was to be ſold to the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhould not have taken notice of this Vote, but that I ſhall have occaſion to make further uſe of it hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The Ninth day of <hi>April</hi> the Houſe further Voted,<note place="margin">☞</note> that thoſe who did adviſe his Majeſty to part with <hi>Tangier</hi> to any Foreign Prince or State, or were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental therein, ought to be Accounted Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the eighth of <hi>April,</hi> the Bill relating to the Convocation was read, and referr'd to a Committee.</p>
                     <p>And then they fell to debate the Reaſons againſt the Amendments of the Lords to the Bill againſt the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56751:23"/>E. of <hi>D.</hi> which chiefly ſtood upon this point, that the Bill was by them changed from a Bill of Attainder to a Bill of Baniſhment, which the Commons could not conſent to. 1. Becauſe 'twas not the legal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Treaſon. 2. That he might make uſe of the remiſſion as an Argument of their diſtruſt of their proofs againſt him. 3. That it would encourage others to withdraw themſelves as he had. See the Reaſons at large in the Printed <hi>Journal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Bill was read the third time, and paſſed, and ſent up to the Lords.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day was a conference betwixt the Lords and Commons about the E. of <hi>D.</hi> Bill, wherein the Lords prayed a Mitigation of the ſaid Bill. Which was referred by the Commons to be conſidered the next day.</p>
                     <p>When their deſire was denyed,<note place="margin">April <hi>9.</hi>
                        </note> and Reaſons ordered to be drawn up againſt it.</p>
                     <p>The next day there was two ſeveral Conferences about this Bill. But no report of either of them entered that day in the Journalls of the Houſe of Commons, but they are entered on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> And it appears that the Commons reſolved then to ſtand to the Bill without the Amendments.</p>
                     <p>In the Houſe of Lords on <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> complained that one Mr. <hi>Sidway</hi> had put an information againſt himſelf and ſome others of the Lord Biſhops that was very derogatory to them; and thereupon the Houſe commanded the buſineſs to be brought before them, and ſtopt the proceedings of their Committee of Secrecy in that and all other things relating to any Member of their Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Where the buſineſs being heard on the <hi>Monday</hi> following, the ſaid <hi>John Sidway</hi> was Committed to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56751:24"/>the Priſon of the <hi>Gatehouſe,</hi> for bringing a frivolous and untrue accuſation againſt the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> and other Biſhops, though ſeveral Lords diſſented.</p>
                     <p>So the Biſhops were quitted that time with Honour, as I wiſh they always may be, and that their enemies may meet with that ſhame and confuſion they deſerve, who through their ſides ſtrike at the Lords Anointed, and endeavour to ruine both the Church and State, by changing the Government from a Monarchy to a Common-wealth, as experience taught us once before, when the Crown ſoon followed the Miter, and the Temporal Lords the Biſhops.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> four of the five Lords in the Tower were brought to the Houſe of Lords, and heard the Articles readagainſt them, and had Copies of them, and were aſſigned their Counſel for matter of Law, but not for matter of Fact, and had time to anſwer till the <hi>15th</hi> Inſtant. But the Lord <hi>Bellaſys</hi> not being able to appear, by reaſon he was lame of the <hi>Gout,</hi> was excuſed, and had a Copy of the Articles ſent him.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> at a conference, the Lords conſented to paſs the Bill againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> without any amendment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> A Bill for ſecuring the King and Kingdom againſt the growh and Danger of Popery, was read the ſecond time and commttied to a Committee.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day a Meſſage was brought from the Lords, that the E. of <hi>D.</hi> had rendered himſelf and was ſent to the Tower.</p>
                     <p>And by another Meſſage word was ſent, that the four Lords had Appeared, had ſent in their Anſwers to the Articles upon which they had been proceeded againſt, which Anſwers they ſent down to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, being the Originalls, and the Lords deſired the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56751:24"/>return of them with all convenient ſpeed, that they might conſider of them.</p>
                     <p>And then the Commons Voted his Majeſty a ſupply for the Disbanding the reſt of the Forces not disbanded by the former Act. To be levied by a Land Tax in ſix Months. By which all Forces raiſed or brought over from Foreign parts ſince the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1677. were to be disbanded. The Commiſſion Officers being to be paid only to the firſt of this <hi>April.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next day a debate ariſing,<note place="margin">Thurſday <hi>the</hi> 17 <hi>of</hi> April.</note> whether the Mony for Disbanding the Army ſhould be paid into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer? it was carried in the Affirmative by 60 Voices.</p>
                     <p>A Committee of Secrecy was appointed to prepare and draw up evidence againſt the E. of <hi>Danby,</hi> and alſo further Articles, as they ſhould ſee cauſe.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> a Bill for prevention of raiſing Mony upon the Subjects but by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was read the firſt time, and ordered to be read a ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>A Bill for exporting Cloth to <hi>Turkie</hi> was read a firſt time, and ordered to be read again.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the E. of <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Bellaſys</hi> appeared at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, and put in their ſeveral Anſwers, which were ſent down to the Commons, with deſire they might be returned with all convenient ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> it was reſolved in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,<note place="margin">26 <hi>of</hi> April.</note> that they would the <hi>Friday</hi> following take into conſideration how to make the law for prohibiting the importation of <hi>French</hi> Commodities more effectual.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> Appeared this day at the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, and retracted their former Plea's and put in their Anſwers, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56751:25"/>were by a Meſſage ſent down to the Commons, which were read, and referred to the Committee of Secrecy belonging to the ſaid Houſe.</p>
                     <p>This day the Houſe of Commons reſolved, <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And accordingly they did ſit, and began the day very inauſpiciouſly with reading an Addreſs to his Majeſty for the Execution of <hi>Pickering,</hi> who as they ſaid had been imployed by ſome of the Conſpirators, to execute their Execrable deſign of Murdering his Majeſty, and upon his Tryal was found guilty thereof; as alſo of divers Prieſts and Jeſuits, who ſtood then Condemned by his Majeſties Judges at the <hi>Old-Bayley;</hi> and in ſeveral of the Circuits.

And though there is nothing to be ſaid for the men, yet I wiſh they had not made this ſevere motion on a Lord's day, it being none of thoſe works of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi>

                           <p>THe Seaſon of the Year advancing ſo faſt, I thought it neceſſary to put you in mind of three particulars:</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. Proſecuting the Plot,</item>

                           <p>And to ſhew you, that whilſt you are doing your parts, my thoughts have not been miſimployed; but that it is my conſtant care to do every thing that may preſerve your Religion, and ſecure it for the future in all events.</p>
                           <p>I have commanded my Lord Chancellor to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral particulars, which I hope will be an evidence that in all things that concern the Publick ſecurity, I ſhall not follow your zeal but lead it.</p>

                              <salute>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons.</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>THat Royal care which his Majeſty hath taken for the general quiet, and ſatisfaction of all his Subjects, is now more evident by theſe new and freſh inſtances of it, which I have in command to open to you.</p>
                           <p>His Majeſty hath conſidered with himſelf, that it is not enough that your Religion and Liberty is ſecure during his own Reign, but he thinks he owes it to his people to do all that in him lies, that theſe bleſſings may be tranſmitted to your poſterity, and ſo well ſecured to them, that no ſucceſſion in after Ages may be able to work the leſt alteration.</p>
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56751:26"/>
                           <p>And therefore his Majeſty, who hath often ſaid in this place that he is ready to conſent to any Laws of this kind, ſo that the ſame extend not to alter the deſcent of the Crown in the Right Line, nor to defeat the Succeſſion, hath now commanded this to be further explained.</p>
                           <p>And to the end it may never be in the power of any <hi>Papiſt,</hi> if the Crown deſcend upon him, to make any change either in Church or State, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to tell you, that his Majeſty is willing that proviſion may be made, firſt to diſtinguiſh a Papiſt from a Proteſtant Succeſſor; then to limit and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe the Authority of a Popiſh Succeſſor in theſe caſes following, that he may be diſabled to do any harm; firſt in reference to the Church, his Majeſtie; is content that care may be taken, that all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and ſpiritual Benefices and promotions in the Gift of the Crown, may be conferred in ſuch a manner, that we may be ſure the Incumbents ſhall always be of the moſt Pious and learned Proteſtants: And that no Popiſh Succeſſor (while he continues ſo) may have any power to controul ſuch preferments.</p>
                           <p>In reference to the State and civil part of the Government, as it is already provided that no Papiſt can ſit in either Houſe of Parliament, ſo the King is pleaſed, that it be provided too, that there may never want a Parliament when the King ſhall happen to dy: But that the Parliament then in being, may continue indiſſolvable for a compleat time, or if there be no Parliament then in being, then that the laſt Parliament, which was in being before that time, may reaſſemble, and ſit a competent time, without any new Summons or Elections.</p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56751:27"/>
                           <p>And as no Papiſt can by Law hold any place of truſt, ſo the King is content, that it may be further provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that no Lords or other of the Privy Council, no Judges of the common Law, nor in Chancery, ſhall at any time during the Reign of any Popiſh Succeſſor, be put in, or diſplaced, but by the Authority of Parliament.</p>
                           <p>And that care alſo be taken that none but ſincere Proteſtants may be Juſtices of the Peace.</p>
                           <p>In reference to the Military part, the King is willing that no Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy Lieutenant, nor no Officer in the Navy (during the Reign of any Popiſh Succeſſor) be put out or removed but either by Authority of Parliament, or of ſuch perſons as the Parliament ſhall intruſt with ſuch Authority.</p>
                           <p>'Tis hard to invent another reſtraint to be put upon a Popiſh Succeſſor, conſidering how much the Revenue of the Succeſſor will depend upon conſent of Parliament, and how impoſſible it is to raiſe mony without ſuch conſent. But yet if any thing elſe can occur to the Wiſdom of the Parliament, which may further ſecure Religion and liberty againſt a Popiſh Succeſſor, without defeating the Right of Succeſſion it ſelf, his Majeſty will moſt readily conſent to it.</p>
                           <p>Thus watchful is the King for all your ſafety, and if he could think of any thing elſe that you do either want or wiſh, to make you happy, he would make it his buſineſs to effect it for you,</p>
                           <p>God Almighty long continue this bleſſed Union between the King and his Parliament and people.</p>

                     <p>The Houſe of Commons returning, reſolved to Adjourn the <hi>conſideration</hi> of his Majeſties Speech till the next <hi>Monday</hi> Morning.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56751:27"/>
                     <p>And now let any man but ſeriouſly conſider the Condeſcention of theſe propoſals, and that they were franlly and freely offered, before the Houſe of Commons had obliged themſelves in point of Honour, to ſtand to any Vote of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> (for that was not then made) and he muſt then be amazed to ſee to what extremities matters have proceeded, during <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>two laſt</hi> Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>But who can brook the impudence of thoſe men, who have notwithſtanding this, by Tales and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets endeavoured to repreſent his ſacred Majeſty to his people as a favourer of Papiſts and Popery.</p>
                     <p>Some men may poſſibly ſay, that all this will not infallibly ſecure us againſt Popery, and I ſay nothing can make any thing in this lower world ſteady and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, but it is more likely to do it than the <hi>excluſion Bill,</hi> becauſe it diſarms a Popiſh Succeſſor of the tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and opportunity of enſlaving us by force, where as the other puts the Sword into his hand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells him to try his fortune for the whole, the event of which is much more uncertain than ſome pretend, who truſting now to force and number, will in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood find themſelves diſappointed by men, and puniſhed by God for their diſtruſt of his providence; and reliance on the Arm of Fleſh, if not ruined by their over great confidence in the number of their party, which often have deceived men in ſuch occaſions. But this it not the place of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, but that they broke looſe here againſt my will.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Commons gave leave to bring in a Bill,<note place="margin">1. <hi>of</hi> May.</note> that when any Member of their Houſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any Office or place of profit, a new Writ ſhould immediately iſſue out, for Electing of a Member to ſerve in his ſtead: This was to keep the party to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56751:28"/>and to prevent the Miniſters from bying off any of them by preferment,<note place="margin">Seaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to both Houſes, <hi>p. 10.</hi>
                        </note> and it is to be wiſhed it had paſſed, for that would have leſſened their Numbers, and have taken off all thoſe that hoped to riſe by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Court,</hi> as they call it, but indeed to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Morarchy:</hi> In the interim it may be a caution to the Country, that they take not all theſe Gentlemen to be what they pretend to be, for that apparently ſome of them were driving a Market for Preferments, how much ſoever they had clamoured their predeceſſors on that account.</p>
                     <p>This day alſo Dr. <hi>John Nalſon,</hi> who had been a long time Impriſoned and put to vaſt charge for Writing the <hi>Letter of Advice from a Jeſuite in</hi> Paris <hi>to his corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent in</hi> London, was diſcharged without aſſigning any reaſon or Law for this way of proceeding againſt him, which was never yet uſed againſt any of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the moſt virulent Libells, againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Religion by Law eſtabliſhed, and they Voted alſo, <hi>that an Addreſs ſhould be made to his Majeſty, by ſuch Members of their Houſe as were of his Majeſties Privy Counſel, to deſire his Majeſty to Command the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to put him out of the Commiſſion of the Peace.</hi> Becauſe it ſeems his Impriſonment was not puniſhment enough for ſo great an offence as this:<note place="margin">Exact Coll. of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable debates <hi>&amp;c. p. 337.</hi>
                        </note> And the Writing ſeveral other books to revive the memory of 1641. as one of the Members expreſſed it, in the following Parliament; when it ſeems they meant to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fling at him; for though his Majeſty can pardon and forgive, there are that cannot. But I believe they have got no great matter by this: Nor was the Doctor turn'd out of the Commiſſion for all their Addreſs, his Majeſty knowing this would not ſuit his Intereſt.</p>

                        </note> the Commons agreed an Addreſs to his Majeſty againſt <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pretences of fears and jealouſies, deſiring he might be removed from his Majeſties Counſels in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> putting his Majeſty in mind of the Addreſs of the laſt Parliament to that purpoſe, and reſolved, they would attend his Majeſty in a body.</p>
                     <p>The Commons deſired a Conference with the Lords, to ſtate before hand the manner of proceedings in the Tryal of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and of the five Popiſh Lords, and took exceptions to their motion for a Lord High Steward.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> his Majeſty ſent for the Commons, and paſſed the Bill for Disbanding the Army, and ſuch other Bills as were ready, which was wiſely done; for by this ſurprize other debates were prevented, which might have prov'd of dangerous conſequence. After this, they appointed a Committee to inſpect the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, and ſearch Preſidents touching the carrying up of Bills, and what previous intimation ought to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56751:29"/>given to them of his Majeſties intention to paſs Bills, and from and by whom ſuch notice hath uſually been given, and whether the Houſe may debate after the meſſage delivered by the Black Rod, for attendance of the Houſe upon his Majeſty. It would have been very unhappy if by reaſon of theſe Debates, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then on foot ſhould have continued undisbanded. By all which as much as is poſſible to conjecture, it would have been very unhappy if by reaſon of theſe Debates, the Forces then on foot ſhould have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued undisbanded to the great damage of the King and Kingdom (notwithſtanding the common clamour againſt them) if his Majeſty had not thus prevented it.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Commons paſſed this Vote, <hi>that no Commoner whatſoever, ſhould preſume to maintain the Validity of the pardon, pleaded by the E. of</hi> Danby, <hi>without the leave of their houſe firſt had,</hi> and <hi>that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo doing ſhould be accounted betrayers of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Commons of</hi> England: and Ordered this Vote to be poſted up at <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> Gate, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants-Innes,</hi> and <hi>Innes of Court.</hi>

                     <p>The firſt thing the Commons did on <hi>Saturday</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the Reading of an Addreſs to the King for the raiſing of the Militia of <hi>London, Weſtminſter,</hi> the <hi>Tower Hamlets,</hi> and Counties of <hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi> for the ſecurity of his Majeſties Perſon at the Tryal of the <hi>Popiſh Lords,</hi> by reaſon of the Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of the <hi>Jeſuits, Popiſh Prieſts</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants</hi> at that time in contempt of his Majeſties Laws and Royal Proclamation; to which they deſired the Concurrence of the Lords, to which they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed.</p>

                     <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the Lords agreed to the demand of the Commons for the appointing a Committee of both Houſes to ſtate the Preliminaries of the tryals to be had, to meet the next day.<note place="margin">May 11.</note>

                     <p>Which was in purſuance of their former Vote, on <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> Though the Lords who had been twiſe deſired to concur in that vote, had given no anſwer to it.

                     <p>
                        <hi>That in defence of the Kings perſon and the Proteſtant Religion, this houſe doth declare, that they will ſtand by his Majeſty with their Lives and Fortunes; and that if his Majeſty ſhould come by any violent death (which God forbid) that they will revenge it to the utmoſt upon the Papiſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As if it had been impoſſible his Majeſty ſhould be murthered by any other then a Papiſt; or that it had been any conſolation to his Majeſty to have known that his death ſhould have been revenged to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on them who ever had been the cauſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of it.</p>
                     <p>This prov'd the occaſion of breaking all the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Parliaments to this day, and thereby to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Popiſh Lords in the Tower from Tryal, and to prevent all the excellent Laws that were then under conſideration againſt Popery, from ever being brought to paſs. And finally, it prov'd an obſtacle of union between the King and the Houſes, to the great advantage of our Enemies at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; to the great hazard of the Nation: and more
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56751:31"/>eſpecially of the Proteſtant Religion which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſecured by it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſay more of this Vote and the former here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when the effects of them will appear better then they did at firſt.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> his Majeſty ſent another Meſſage to the Commons to put them again in mind of the Fleet,<note place="margin">May 14.</note> and let them know he would acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the evil conſequences, which the want of a Fleet in ſuch a juncture might produce; and that the entering upon it, could be no hinderance to the other great affairs on their hands, but rather a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the diſpatch thereof.</p>
                     <p>Upon which, a debate ariſing, they adjourn'd the Conſideration of this Meſſage till <hi>Monday</hi> Sennight after: which had the appearance of a denial.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> there aroſe a Controverſy betwixt the two Houſes about the Biſhops;<note place="margin">May 15.</note> for the Lords ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Voted <hi>that the Lords Spiritual have a right to ſtay, and ſit in Court till the Court proceed to the Vote of Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or not guilty.</hi> The Commons oppoſed it, and ſaid, <hi>that the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any Vote in any proceedings upon impeachments againſt the Lords in the Tower;</hi> involving the E. of <hi>Danby</hi>'s caſe, with the other Lords, though it was vaſtly different. And indeed from hence aroſe this conteſt, the Commons imagining that the Biſhops would be for the validity of his pardon, and ſo make a major Vote in that Houſe; and therefore as they had deprived him of his Counſel before, ſo now the buſineſs was to out the moſt favourable part (as they thought) of his Judges.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Bill <hi>to diſinherit the D. of York,</hi> was read the firſt time, and Ordered a ſecond read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <p>After which reſolution, the Lords Spiritual asked the leave of that houſe, <hi>that they might withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Tryals of the ſaid Lords, with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of entring their uſual Proteſtations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon which the Commons Reſolved.</p>
                     <p>That it be given as an inſtruction to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to inſiſt upon the former Vote of this Houſe, <hi>That the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any vote in any Proceedings againſt the Lords in the Tower:</hi> and when that matter ſhall be ſetled <hi>(as they pleaſe, for the Lords had ſetled it)</hi> and the method of proceedings adjuſted, this Houſe ſhall then be ready to proceed upon the Tryal of the E. of <hi>Danby;</hi> againſt whom the Houſe hath already demanded judgment: and afterwards to the Tryal of the other five Lords in the Tower.</p>
                     <p>So here was the two Houſes in their Votes point blank againſt one another.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here take notice of ſome Arguments that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betwixt the Lords and the Commons as they are expreſſed in the Lords Journal.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> The Commons deſired to know concerning the Biſhops being preſent at the Tryals of the Lords impeached, to which the Lords made this Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>That it belonged not to the Commons to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Conſtituting parts of the Court, upon ſuch Tryals; but that the judgment of this matter belongs entirely to the Lords, and when they have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56751:32"/>adjudged it, the Commons cannot alter it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould not debate it. Upon which the Commons acknowledged, that Judgment after Tryal is in the Lords, but their Lordſhips are not to give judgment, unleſs the Commons demand it, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons deſire to know whether the Lords will proceed in theſe Tryals, as their Lordſhips did anciently; for if the Biſhops ſhould ſit upon theſe Tryals, they ſhould not demand Judgment, but being diſſatisfied with their being there, and it may be the Commons may proceed by Bill. To which the Lords made Anſwer, that after the Evidence is fully heard, they are bound to give judgment of Condemnation or Acquittal; but this being a matter of Judicature, the Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they would impoſe ſilence upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and debate it no further. The Commons fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired to know whether the Biſhops ſhould be allowed to vote upon the Validity of the pardon of the E. of <hi>Danby,</hi> which they account no Preliminary but the very eſſence of the Tryal.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Votes I have mentioned before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communicated by the Lords to the Commons, the Commons anſwered, <hi>That if the pardon of the E. of Danby infer Life and Death, it is the ſame with Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or not Guilty, and deſired again to know whether the Lords Spiritual ſhould Vote upon the E. of D. Pardon,</hi> in anſwer to which, the Lords ſaid <hi>they had no Inſtructions in that point, but would acquaint the Houſe with it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the Commons inſiſted, <hi>that the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any Vote in any of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon the impeachments againſt the Lords in the Tower,</hi> and the Commons declared <hi>that they knew not how to proceed in Capital matters, before a new Court,</hi> to which the Lords would not reply.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56751:32"/>
                     <p>So the Lords voted, <hi>that Thurſday next ſhould be appointed to begin the Tryals of the five Popiſh Lords.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After which the Lords Spiritual deſired leave of the Houſe <hi>that they might withdraw themſelves from the Tryals of the ſaid Lords, with the liberty of entering their uſual Proteſtations;</hi> as I have formerly ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And it was Ordered that the Reſolution of the Lords Houſe and the deſire of the Lords Spiritual ſhould be communicated to the Committee of the Houſe of Commons the next Morning.</p>
                     <p>This being ſo done, the Commons inſiſted, <hi>that their Vote extended to the E. of Danby as well as the five Lords, whereas the Lords Vote relate only to the five Lords, and therefore they deſired to know what anſwer the Lords would give as to the E. of</hi> Danby, <hi>they further objected, that they conceived, that their vote was as to the Right of the thing, and that the Biſhops have no right to be at any Vote in any capital caſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And they conceived the E. of Ds. to be a Capital caſe, as well as the caſes of the other five Lords, and that if the Biſhops may have leave to withdraw, it implies a right, which if they have, it is a new Court which the Commons cannot admit of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lords reply'd <hi>there is no day yet appointed for the tryal of the E. of D. and that the Lords Spiritual will be abſent at all the parts of the Tryals of the five Lords, and that the Proteſtations they now deſire to enter, will be the ſame as in the Earl of</hi> Strafford<hi>'s caſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Commons ſaid <hi>they could not proceed to treat of any other Propoſals, till ſuch time as the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about the Court be ſetled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>19th of May</hi> the Commons further inſiſted <hi>that the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any Vote in the proceeding againſt the Lords in the Tower, and when that matter ſhall be ſetled, and the Method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56751:33"/>adjusted their Houſe would be then ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the Tryal of the Pardon of the E. of</hi> Danby, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the Commons had already demanded judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterwards to the tryal of the five Lords in the Tower.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon which the Lords told them <hi>they had no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to debate this Matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note that the tryal of the E. of D. was render'd impoſſible, by Voting no Commoner of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be of Counſel with him, or defend the validity of his pardon. <hi>2ly,</hi> That all this conteſt about the Biſhops was only in relation to the Earl's caſe. <hi>3ly,</hi> That they inſinuate they would proceed by Bill, all which were Declarations they meant to force the Lords as much as in them lay to condemn the E. one way or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as the Long Parliament forced his Majeſties Father, and the Houſe of Lords againſt their declared judgments, to condemn the E. of <hi>Strafford.</hi> But to go on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="margDblQuotes">The Commons then further ſaid that the Lords reſolution which was offered, was no anſwer to their propoſition; which comprehended the E. of <hi>D.</hi> as well as the five Lords: beſides the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was doubtful, for it appears that the Biſhops asked leave to be abſent, but it appeared not that it was granted, then conſequently the Biſhops muſt ſit in Court at the Tryals; that the Commons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Biſhops abſenting themſelves by way of Leave, is a ſtrong implication of a right aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q> which they cannot allow, can ever be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>(yet this they were told, let it imply what it will)</hi> was allowed them in the caſe of the E. of <hi>Strafford</hi> in Parliament by a houſe of Commons that were no great Friends to Biſhops, and why could not the Commons now be contented with what was practiſed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56751:33"/>then and at all other times? and (the Commons) did think (they ſaid) there was the ſame reaſon for the Biſhops being abſent from the Tryal, upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as from the tryal of the other five Lords, and that the naming of a day for the tryal of the five Lords, before the tryal of the pardon of the E. of <hi>Danby,</hi> againſt whom the Commons had already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Judgment, as the putting that laſt which they deſired ſhould be firſt.</p>
                     <p>To which the Lords told them, <hi>they were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to debate, but would impart theſe Matters to the Houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Commons hereupon replied, <hi>they were ready to go on, and that for want of theſe trials all publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſtood ſtill,</hi> but the Lords ſeem'd to lay the ſtop at the Commons door, by naming a day, which they conceived ought not to have been appointed, before the Methods were conſidered, for the Lords had not anſwered the Commons in matter of Right, <hi>(which never was, nor it may be will be anſwered)</hi> which was neceſſary firſt to be adjuſted, and they deſired their reſolution as to that matter; for they conceived they (the Biſhops) had no right <hi>(which whether they had or no, there was no more neceſſity of determining it then, then heretofore)</hi> and the Lords might as well make the Judges part of their Court, as the Biſhops in this point; As they ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And they ſaid, <hi>the Commons would give no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to the Ancient judicature, for they own'd that to be ſacred, and they conceived they had a right to know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what Court they ſhall appear, and they hoped the Lords would conſider of their having appointed a day, before the Methods were conſidered, and would give them leave to wonder at it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is as likely the Lords took leave all this time to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56751:34"/>wonder at the Commons too; and it is likely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity will wonder that all this Controverſy ſhould be banded thus, when it was thought to have been full time at leaſt, to have been trying the five Lords, and diſpatching the Bills againſt Popery.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the Lords having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain conſidered of all this, in a Committee of the whole Houſe; gave further day for the Tryal of the five Lords till that day ſennight.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day, the Commons read the Bill <hi>for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the City of</hi> London, <hi>and parts adjacent, from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Inhabitants,</hi> with the Amendments the third time; and having added two clauſes, return'd it to the Lords from whom it came.</p>
                     <p>The Bill <hi>for diſabling the D. of</hi> York <hi>to inherit the imperial Crown of this Realm,</hi> being read the ſecond time, and the queſtion put whether it ſhould be committed, the Houſe divided, and there were for the
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Yeas</hi>—207.</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Noes</hi>—128.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo it was reſolved in the affirmative. And the Bill was committed to a Committee of the whole Houſe, which was to ſit the <hi>Friday</hi> following.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>May, John Wilſon</hi> and <hi>Roger Beckwith</hi> Eſquires, the two <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Juſtices of the peace, who were ſent for into cuſtody, for ſaying this was no Parliament; exhibited in the Houſe a Petition under the Hands of Eight Juſtices of the peace of the North Riding of the County of <hi>York:</hi> certifying that they were all preſent at the Seſſions at <hi>Thirske</hi> the firſt of <hi>May</hi> 1679, when <hi>John Wilſon</hi> Eſq; being deſired to give his opinion whether the Act for Settlement of the poor of the 14 of <hi>Car.</hi> 2, which was to continue to the end of the firſt Seſſion of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56751:34"/>next Parliament was ſtill in force; to which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, it was doubtful, in regard they had not yet made any Act, and is not a Parliament in Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Record remains of it; to which it ſeems the other aſſented, and all the ſaid Juſtices certify that neither of them did then ſpeak any words derogatory to the Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Now this doubt did ariſe by reaſon of the proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the beginning of this Parliament before the Speaker was choſen; which ſeemed to make a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Commons Ordered that they ſhould be diſcharged, paying their fees.</p>
                     <p>But who ſhould make theſe Gentlemen any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the trouble, charge, and injury they had ſuſtained by this impriſonment, was a matter they were not then at leiſure to conſider. But in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of a Parliament, it may be worth their while to look into the authorities that enabled them to impriſon their fellow Subjects upon a bare, and it may be falſe and malicious Suggeſtion, who are no members of their houſe. But if they ſhall not be pleas'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it themſelves, the reſt of the Gentry will, and take other Meaſures perhaps for the future; in regard that no man is ſecure of his Liberty in time of Parliament at this boundleſs rate of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> 23 of <hi>May</hi> 1679, the Houſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Sir <hi>Stephen Fox</hi> had paid ſeveral Sums of Money to ſome of the Members of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that he had books of Accounts to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the ſame: firſt they ordered,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That he ſhould be immediately ſent for to attend the Houſe, and to bring with him all the Books and Papers of Accounts of any moneys he has paid to any Members
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56751:35"/>of the laſt Parliament.</q> And preſently again</p>
                     <p>Ordered,</p>
                     <q>That Sir S.F. do forthwith produce to this Houſe his Leiger Book, Caſh Book and Journal; and his Receipts for money by him paid for ſecret Services, and that he be injoyned not to go out of the Company of the Members (they ſent with him) before they return to the Houſe.</q>
                     <p>Ordered again,</p>
                     <q>That no Members depart the Service of the Houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Sir S.F. and the other Members return.</q>
                     <p>Ordered again,</p>
                     <q>That Sir F. Winnington do to morrow morning make a report of the informations given to the Committee of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy, touching Money paid for Secret Services to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the laſt Parliament.</q>
                     <p>Ordered again,</p>
                     <q>That Sir S. Fox do upon his Memory, name to the Houſe ſuch Members of the laſt Parliament, as he paid any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to for Secret Service.</q>
                     <p>There is no Entry of the Perſons by them named, but many Liſts of them in writing were preſently ſpread about the Nation, ſome of which had more Names, and others fewer, according to the affection of the Tranſcribers, and ſo the Honour of many an honeſt Gentleman, was under-hand blaſted; with the people eſpecially, there being no way left to rectify this falſehood, but by repairing to Sir <hi>Stephen Fox</hi> for a Certificate, and that would not have been belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neither by their Enemies, whilſt their friends did not need it.</p>
                     <p>As I recommended one conſideration before to our Parliament men, relating to our Liberties, ſo they may be pleaſed to take another along with them for our honours, for it ſeems if a man be impriſoned or accuſed by the Order of the Commons in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56751:35"/>though never ſo wrongfully, he ſhall hardly obtain any relief; and therefore great care ought to be taken not to precipitate matters of this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Now Sir <hi>Stephen Fox</hi> might poſſibly have given a better account next morning in Writing, then thus haſtily upon his memory; and there the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men accuſed, might have been heard what they could ſay for themſelves, before they had been defamed to the whole Nation, and after that an exact account might have been given in Print, without leaving it to the Liberty of every man to add and diminiſh as he pleaſed. Such inconveniences as theſe, will ever follow haſty Counſels, which therefore ought to be avoided; if they be not, the injury will at one time or another be repay'd with Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this matter, as there was never any Law to prohibit Parliament-men from taking the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of our Princes in time of Parliament, ſo there was the greater reaſon for it in this Parliament, which laſted too long, to the Ruine of many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of ſmall eſtate, who were Members of it; the cuſtom of taking Wages being then wholly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and as this tended to make them odious to the People, ſo it reflected upon his Majeſty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to have been purſued with great Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and care alſo ought to have been taken for the time to come, by allowing better Wages, and making it duely paid; without which, this thing will never be prevented.</p>
                     <p>All which is ſaid not to accuſe Sir <hi>Stephen Fox</hi> or the Gentlemen that were accuſed by him, but to ſhow what injuries may and will happen, as often as that great Body acts with too much warmth, and how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is to redreſs what might eaſily enough have been prevented, which I deſire may end in the honour of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56751:36"/>by making them Act with all poſſible reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs and caution for the future.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday, May</hi> the <hi>24th,</hi> the Commons ordered an Anſwer to be return'd to the laſt Meſſage of the houſe of Peers, touching the Appointment of <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> for the Tryal of the five Lords in the Tower, with reaſons why they could not proceed to the Tryal of thoſe five Lords, before judgment given upon the E. of <hi>D's.</hi> plea of his Pardon, and the point of the Biſhops not Voting in any proceedings, upon impeachments for Capital offences were ſetled, and the methods of Proceedings adjuſted, and that a Committee ſhould be appointed to draw up theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p>A Petition being exhibited the ſame day to the Commons by Sir <hi>Thomas Hare, John Trinham</hi> Eſq; and others on the behalf of themſelves, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the Freeholders of the County of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Complaining of ſeveral rude and illegal practiſes, in Electing and Returning Sir <hi>John Hobart</hi> to ſerve in that Parliament, as Knight of the Shire for the ſaid County of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> and the Petitioners having in their Petition ſet forth, that by reaſon of Printing and Publiſhing of the Reſolves and Orders of the Houſe, the Free-holders of the ſaid County, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted and terrified.</p>
                     <p>And a Motion being made that the ſaid Petition might be rejected, the ſame was upon the queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> reported from the Committee of Secrecy, ſeveral Informations <hi>of Moneys paid for Secret Service to the Members of the laſt Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon they Ordered, <hi>that one Mr.</hi> Knight, <hi>and Sir</hi> Richard Wiſeman, <hi>ſhould be immediately ſent for to attend the Houſe. And that the Speaker ſhould Iſſue out
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56751:36"/>his Warrant, for the ſummoning of ſuch Witneſſes as ſhould be Named to him, by any Member of their Houſe, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Moneys paid for Secret Service.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then Adjourned the Debate of that affair till Tueſday Morning following; when his Majeſty put an end to this and all their other proceedings.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the Commons drew up reaſons why they could not proceed to the Tryal of the five impeach'd Popiſh Lords, till they had their demands in relation to the E. of <hi>Danby,</hi> and the Biſhops; which are too long to be here inſerted, not without ſome ſeeming reflexions upon the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Honſe of Peers.</p>
                     <p>But I need not interpoſe betwixt them, the Lords are better able to Juſtify and Vindicate their Cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Commons then I am; and it is fit I ſhould leave it to them.</p>
                     <p>Yet I cannot but take notice, they never gave any reaſon for their Vote of the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>May; That no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner whatſoever ſhould preſume to maintain the Validity of the Pardon pleaded by the E. of</hi> D. <hi>without the leave of their Houſe firſt had and obtained, and that the Perſons ſo doing, ſhould be accounted betrayers of the Liberties of</hi> England. By which Vote it became impoſſible for the Lords to do the E. Juſtice; for his Plea being matter of Law and not of Fact, by the Law of the Land, he ought to have Counſel aſſigned him by the Lords, without the Interpoſition of the Commons, the Lords being his Judges, and the Commons his Accuſers, and by conſequence his Enemies. And it ſeems con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of Natural and Eternal Equity, that a man ſhould have no means to defend his life, but what his Accuſers will allow him: and I believe they themſelves would never have ſubmitted to this. Now Counſel he could have none if they were not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56751:37"/>Commoners (as they that made that Vote will I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe allow,) all the Peers being his Judges, and ſo forecloſed from being of Counſel for him. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Counſel, the Lords neither could nor ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt him, therefore the Commons had made it legally impoſſible to try the E. till that Vote were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd, and this I take to be the true reaſon why their Lordſhips Ordered the Tryals of the five Lords before his, which they did after this Vote, for before that time they were willing to have tryed him firſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Journal.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <hi>2ly.</hi> The Commons give no reaſon why the Biſhops ſhould not be allowed to withdraw upon leave, as they anciently uſed to do; for they do not deny, that anciently they uſe to withdraw upon Leave, though the Lords urged that, nor produce one inſtance, where they were excluded, but upon Leave, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations entered. And therefore there ſeemed to be much Reaſon why the Lords ſhould ſtick to their own Vote, and refuſe to gratify the Commons in this point, to the dammage of the Biſhops.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3ly.</hi> The Commons proceeded a little myſteriouſly with the Lords, under a general term of the Lords in the Tower; including the E. of <hi>D.</hi> by that term, tho his Caſe was vaſtly different, both in matter of Fact, and the manner of the Tryal. For the Lords yielded at the firſt, that the Biſhops ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Tryal of the five Popiſh Lords and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that point ought to have been no further inſiſted on; yet ſtill the Commons urged <hi>that the Biſhops ought not to be preſent at the Tryal of the Lords in the Tower,</hi> including the E. of <hi>D.</hi> in thoſe general Terms, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which ſeemed liker a diſpute at the Bar, then a Treaty betwixt two Committees of the Houſes for an Accommodation.</p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56751:37"/>
                     <p>Now that the E. of <hi>Danby</hi>'s caſe was vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of the five Lords appears from hence. 1. There is nothing charged upon the E. that is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within the Statute of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. c. 2. nor any other Statute that was ever alledged, and ſo it muſt have been debated upon the Tryal whether the Crimes were Treaſon or no, ſuppoſing the matter of Fact had been proved or granted; and of this the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are Judges, as well as the Temporal Lords, and have ever had their Vote in all thoſe Statutes that have made or declared what was, and what was not Treaſon, and particularly in the Statute above cited, which is the great and ſtanding rule, and ſo ought not to be excluded here, but in the caſe of the five Lords it was otherwiſe, for their Treaſons were appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently within the ſaid Statute, if prov'd true. <hi>2ly,</hi> The E's. plea was a meer Law point, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was Valid or not, and the Biſhops are Judges with the Lords Temporal in all points of Law brought before that Houſe. <hi>3ly.</hi> Though the Commons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted that the Event was the ſame as upon <hi>Guilty or not Guilty.</hi> Yet this may be queſtioned, for it ſeems juſt, that if the Pardon had been over-ruled, the E. ſhould have ſtill been in the ſame caſe, as if it had not been granted, and ſo have been tryed again upon the impeachment, and then might have demurr'd to the point in Law, whether the Crimes charged were Treaſon or no, before he had been condemned, and in this point perhaps, the Biſhops had been Judges; and when both theſe points had been heard and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled, then that the matter of fact ſhould have been tryed upon the Plea of <hi>Guilty or not Guilty,</hi> and then the Biſhops ſhould have been abſent. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Commons will find that the Earls reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of abiding by his pardon will amount to no more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56751:38"/>then this, when ever he be tryed, at leaſt it ſeems reaſonable it ſhould not. For there is no reaſon a man ſhould be hanged, becauſe the Attorney General miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in drawing his Pardon, or he in the manner of ſuing it out, without a Tryal. If it be ſaid that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus tollit Errorem,</hi> I anſwer, No man can conſent to his own deſtruction, ſo as to forecloſe him of all lawful means of ſaving his Life. If it be objected that this is too tedious a way of proceeding, I anſwer in the words of the Heathen, <hi>de morte hominis nulla eſt cunctatio Longa;</hi> it being eaſy to cut off a mans Head, and impoſſible to reſtore him to life, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ought to be taken before it be done.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſome will be ready to ſay <hi>a Fools bolt is ſoon ſhot,</hi> and though this is true, yet, I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I may not ſpeak my judgment as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and if I be adjudged an enemy of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England</hi> for my pains, I cannot help it, only I have not medled with the Validity of the pardon in all this, nor I think never will, and ſo I have not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt that Vote.</p>
                     <p>The Concluſion I ſhall draw from hence is, that the Lords had reaſon to put the Tryal of the five Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Lords firſt, and that the Commons neceſſitated them ſo to do, by that Extraordinary Vote, by ſtarting a new Controverſy about the Juriſdiction of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in all Capital cauſes; and by refuſing them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do as they always had done before, that is to withdraw upon Leave, with the uſual proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions entered; all which things were not preſently to be given up, nor could ſuddenly be determined.</p>
                     <p>The reſt of that day was ſpent in two Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the one concerning the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, and the other about the Tryals; in which the Long rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I mentioned were delivered.</p>

                     <p>Who immediately Prorogued both Houſes to the <hi>14th</hi> day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following.</p>
                     <p>The news of this Prorogation of the Parliament, was no ſooner ſpread about the Nation, but the cry was taken up by the zealous Impoſtors, that it was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56751:39"/>done of purpoſe to hinder the Tryal of the Popiſh Lords: for as for the E. of <hi>D.</hi> the People were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unconcern'd what came of him. And dreadful Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were told in Coffee-houſes, Ale-houſes, Taverns, and Meeting houſes of the danger of Popery, and what great favourers they had at Court, not ſparing his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>But this was not all, the Act for Regulating Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, expiring with this Seſſion, of which no care was taken, notwithſtanding his Majeſty recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſo ſeriouſly to the Parliament by the Lord Chancellour, at the opening of it. The Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came preſently ſo peſtred with a ſwarm of Lying, Seditious treaſonable and ſcandalous Pamphlets, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Pictures; that a man would have thought Hell had been broken looſe. His Majeſty, the Church, the Government, were repreſented every day by them in the moſt odious manner that ſpite, falſehood, and malice could invent; to beget a diſaffection in the people to the Government, and to involve us in another Rebellion. And if any man preſumed to Defend them, he was preſently a Papiſt in Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, a Tory or Tantivy man; and very often threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Parliament. All which was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt out of as pure kindneſs to his Majeſty, and to beget honour to the Government, and tended as apparently to the Intereſt and Safety of the Proteſtant Religion, as the <hi>Jews</hi> Crys of <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him,</hi> did to the delivery of our Saviour out of the hands of <hi>Pilate.</hi>

                           <p>You are appointing of the State of <hi>England</hi> to be taken up in a Committee of the whole Houſe, ſome day next week. I do not know how well what I have to ſay may be received, for I never ſtudy either to make my Court well or to be popular; I always ſpeak what I am commanded by the <hi>Dictates of the Spirit within me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There are ſome Conſiderations that concern <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſo neerly that without them you will come far ſhort of ſafety and quiet at home: We have a little Siſter, and ſhe hath no Breaſts; what ſhall we do for our Siſter in the day when ſhe ſhall be ſpoken for? If ſhe be a wall we will build on her a palace of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if ſhe be a door, we will encloſe her with boards of Cedar. We have ſeveral Little Siſters without Breaſts, the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtant Churches, the two Kingdoms of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants are a Wall, the only Wall and defence to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon it you may build Palaces of Silver, Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Palaces. The protection of the Proteſtants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, is the greateſt power and ſecurity the Crown of <hi>England</hi> can attain to, and which can only help us to give check to the growing greatneſs of <hi>France.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56751:40"/>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are two doors, either to let in good or miſchief upon us; they are much weakened by the Artifice of our cunning Enemies, and we ought to Incloſe them with Boards of Cedar.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Popery and Slavery,</hi> like two Siſters, go hand in hand, ſometimes one goes firſt, ſometimes the other, in at doors, but the other is always following cloſe at hand.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>England</hi> Popery was to have brought in Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; in <hi>Scotland</hi> Slavery went before, and Popery was to follow.</p>
                           <p>I do not think your Lordſhips or the Parliament have Jurisdiction there, it is an Ancient Kingdom; they have an Illuſtrious Nobility, a Gallant Gentry, a Learned Clergy, and an underſtanding worthy People: but yet we cannot think of <hi>England</hi> as we ought, without reflecting on the condition they are in. They are under the ſame Prince, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſame Favourites and Councils; when they are hardly dealt with, can we that are the Richer expect better uſage? for 'tis certain, that in all Abſolute Governments, the pooreſt Countries are always moſt favourably dealt with.</p>
                           <p>When the Ancient Nobility and Gentry there, cannot enjoy their Royalties, their Shreivaldoms, and their Stewardaries, which they and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors have poſſeſſed for ſeveral Hundreds of years; but that now they are enjoyned by the Lords of the Council, to make deputations of their Authorities, to ſuch as are their known Enemies.</p>
                           <p>Can we expect to enjoy our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> long, under the ſame Perſons and Adminiſtration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? If the Council Table there can impriſon any Noble-man or Gentleman for ſeveral years, without bringing him to Tryal, or giving the leaſt reaſon for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56751:40"/>what they do; can we expect the ſame men will preſerve the Liberty of the Subject here?</p>
                           <p>I will acknowledge I am not well vers'd in the particular Laws of <hi>Scotland;</hi> but this I do know, that all the Northern Countreys have by their Laws, an undoubted and inviolable Right to their Liberties and Properties; yet <hi>Scotland</hi> hath outdone all the Eaſtern and Southern Countreys, in having their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates ſubjected to the Arbitrary will and pleaſure of them that Govern. They have lately plundered and haraſſed the Richeſt and Wealthieſt Countries of that Kingdom, and brought down the Barbarous <hi>Highlanders</hi> to devour them; and all this without a moſt colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to do it. Nor can there be found a reaſon of State for what they have done, but that thoſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſters deſigned to procure a Rebellion at any rate; which as they managed, was only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the miraculous hand of God, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> would have been armed, and the faireſt opportunity given in the juſt time for the execution of that wicked and bloody de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Papiſts had; and it is not poſſible for any man that duly conſiders it, to think other, but that thoſe Miniſters that acted that, were as guilty of the Plot, as any of the Lords that are in queſtion for it.</p>
                           <p>My Lords, I am forced to ſpeak this the plainer, becauſe till the preſſure be fully and clearly taken off from <hi>Scotland,</hi> 'tis not poſſible for me or any think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to believe that good is meant us here.</p>
                           <p>We muſt ſtill be upon our guard, apprehending that the Principle is not changed at Court, and that theſe men that are ſtill in place and Authority, have that influence upon the Mind of our excellent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56751:41"/>Prince. that he is not, nor cannot be that to us, that his own Nature and Goodneſs would incline him to.</p>
                           <p>I know your Lordſhips can order nothing in this, but there are thoſe that hear me, can put a perfect cure to it; until that be done, the <hi>Scotch Weed</hi> is like Death in the Pot. <hi>Mers in Olla.</hi> But there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too, now I conſider, that moſt immediately concerns us; their Act of Twenty two Thouſand men to be ready to invade us upon all occaſions. This I hear, that the Lords of the Council there, have treated as they do all other Laws, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it into a Standing Army of ſix thouſand men. I am ſure we have reaſon and right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the King that that Act may be better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the next Parliament there. I ſhall ſay no more for <hi>Scotland</hi> at this time, I am afraid your Lordſhips will think I have ſaid too much, having no concern there. But if a <hi>French</hi> Noble-man, ſhould come to dwell in my Houſe and Family, I ſhould think it concerned me to ask what he did in <hi>France,</hi> for if he were there a Felon, a Rogue, a Plunderer, I ſhould deſire him to live elſe-where; and I hope your Lordſhips will do the ſame thing for the Nation, if you find the ſame cauſe.</p>
                           <p>My Lords give me leave to ſpeak two or three words concerning our other Siſter <hi>Ireland;</hi> thither I hear is ſent <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Regiment, to ſecure us againſt the <hi>French.</hi> Beſides I am credibly informed, that the Papiſts have their Arms reſtored, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are not many of them yet recovered from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuſpected Party; the Sea-Towns as well as the Inland, are full of Papiſts: that Kingdom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long continue in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands, if ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care be not taken of it. This is in your power,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56751:41"/>and there is nothing there, but is under your Laws, therefore I beg that this Kingdom at leaſt may be taken in conſideration, together with the State of <hi>England:</hi> for I am ſure there can be no ſafety here, if theſe doors be not ſhut up and made ſure.</p>

London. 1680.</hi> fol.</note> Forty written Coppies of it were ſent from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Edenbrough;</hi> and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks grew ſo inſolent and ſo daring upon it, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Loyal Gentlemen, wrote up accounts, to what height of Inſolences this Speech had blown up the Enemies of the Church and the Monarchy; and that they had juſt reaſons to fear that very dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, if not a down-right Rebellion would ſpeedily enſue thereupon: but thoſe reports found not too much credit at <hi>London;</hi> where the world was made to believe by men (whoſe intereſt it was that they ſhould not be credited) that they were but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> for whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in that conjucture, it was that they ſhould be believed.</p>
                     <p>My Author goes on that he is confident (ſuch is his charity) he that made it,<note place="margin">The Effects.</note> would not have done ſo, had he known the true State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56751:42"/>few <hi>Engliſh</hi> men do, or foreſeen the evil effects, which it immediately had, in encouraging the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanteers to Aſſaſſinate, Maſſacre and Rebel. For now they begin to look and ſpeak big in <hi>Edenbrough;</hi> and many of them were heard and ſeen upon the <hi>Crown of the Cauſway,</hi> who had ſneeked about in darkneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And as for the diſaffected parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they now diſplay'd <hi>the Banners of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (as they Blaſphemouſly call'd their colours) at their Conventicles every where, and their Preachers now told them, <hi>that the time of their deliverance, and of Gods taking Vengeance upon his Enemies, was now at hand; only they muſt repent, and be ſtrong, and of a great courage, and fight the Battles of the Lord.</hi> They alſo threatned in all places, ſuch as they thought were ſeriouſly active againſt them, talking of great Changes and Revolutions in <hi>England,</hi> and in Publick Places, dropt Liſts of the Names of thoſe men, whom they had a mind ſhould fall by Heroical Hands. And in the firſt place naming Dr. <hi>Sharp</hi> the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and Primate of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whom they meekly ſtiled, <hi>That perjured Apoſtate Prelate Sharp.</hi> Threatning to handle him and the reſt ſeverely.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpent a few Weeks in theſe godly Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, animating each other to this good work, and being thereunto further encouraged by the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>London,</hi> the third of <hi>May</hi> following, they began the work with the murther of the ſaid Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop; and I will inform you of the manner of that Butchery in the words of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
                     <p>The Archbiſhop had been attending his Majeſties Service in the Privy Council at <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> from thence he went over into <hi>Fife,</hi> in the after-noon, on the Second of <hi>May</hi> 1679. That night he lodged at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56751:42"/>Captain <hi>Seaton</hi>'s Houſe, in a Village called <hi>Kenno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> which is in the Mid-way betwixt <hi>Bruntiſland</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> About Midnight as the People of the Town report, two men well mounted and armed, came thither to enquire if the Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> was Lodged at Captain <hi>Seaton</hi>'s; and as ſoon as they were informed that he was, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rode out of the Town again.</p>
                     <p>The next morning being the Third of <hi>May,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parties of Horſe-men were ſeen to traverſe the Road betwixt <hi>Kennoway</hi> and St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who doubtleſs were the Aſſaſſins, who watched for an opportunity to effect the Murther which they had long deſigned. But the Lord Primate who was a man of great Natural courage, and whom ſo many deliverances for almoſt Twenty years, from the hands of thoſe bloody Zealots, had now brought to an entire confidence in God's Protection, took Coach about Nine of the Clock, without any preſage or apprehenſion of danger.</p>
                     <p>He had none but his Eldeſt Daughter to ride with him in the Coach, and only three Servants on Horſe-back to attend him; one of whom he had ſent before he was aſſaulted, to pay his reſpects to a Perſon of Honour, by whoſe houſe he paſſed on his Road. He advanced on his journey in great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity till he came to a little Country Village called <hi>Magus,</hi> two miles diſtant from St. <hi>Andrews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Eleven and Twelve a Clock in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</p>
                     <p>There he firſt perceived himſelf to be purſued by Eleven or Twelve men barefaced, well mounted, with Piſtols cocked in their hands, and drawn Swords hanging in Strings from their Armes; as ſoon as he ſpied them, he bid his Coachman drive as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56751:43"/>faſt as his Horſes could gallop, but alas too late, for the Aſſaſſin furiouſly purſued him, and in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute, ſhot at him ſeveral times in his Coach, running as faſt as ſix good Horſes could draw it. The Coachman (who diſcovered the Villains before his Lord, and had thereupon begged leave of him, but was not permitted to gallop away) had certainly outdriven them, if one <hi>Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock,</hi> mounted on a very fleet bay horſe, had not overtaken them; who not daring to attack the Coachman, becauſe his Whip did fright his Sprightly horſe, therefore rod up to the Poſtilion, whom he wounded with his Sword in the face, ſhot one of the foremoſt Horſes, and hamſtringed the other, and ſo ſtopped the Coach.</p>
                     <p>By that time this was done, the reſt of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers came up, and one of them fired a Piſtol or Blunderbuſs ſo near his Breaſt, that his Daughter rubbed off the burning which ſtuck to his Gown. Then they called him by the Name of <hi>Dog, Villain, Apoſtate, Perſecuter of the Godly, Betrayer of Jeſus Chriſt and his Church,</hi> and bid him come out of his Coach, to receive what he deſerved for his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt the Kirk of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon this his Daughter got out of the Coach, and fell on her knees, begging her Father's Life; but they regarded neither her Prayers nor Tears, but threw her down ſeveral times upon the ground, trampled upon her and wounded her: which her tender hearted Father ſeeing, after much reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Language, and many Threatnings, came meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Coach, and with calmneſs ſaid unto them, <hi>Gentlemen, I know not that I have ever inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any of you, or if I did I am ready to make you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; and therefore I beſeech you to ſpare my life, and I promiſe I will never purſue you for this violence,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56751:43"/>and I pray you conſider, before you bring the guilt of Innocent blood upon your ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reverence of his Preſence, and his undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage in addreſſing himſelf ſo reſolutely and gravely unto them, ſurpriſed them, and made them ſtand a little while, as it were unreſolved what to do; and one of them relenting, Cried to the reſt, <hi>Spare theſe Grey Hairs:</hi> but their cruel Zeal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their Natural Pity and Juſtice, pauſed not long before they replyed, <hi>He muſt die, He muſt die.</hi> And then again calling him <hi>Traiterous Villain, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, betrayer of the Intereſt of Chriſt, Enemy to God and his People,</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou ſhalt now receive the reward of thy Apoſtacy, and enmity to the People of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then ſeeing them determined to take away his Life, he begged a little while to pray, <hi>telling them, he would pray for them;</hi> but they ſcornfully told him, <hi>That they cared not for his Prayers, being ſure that God would not hear ſo baſe a Dog as he was.</hi> Then looking ſtedfaſtly upon one of the Aſſaſſins, whom he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know, he kneeled down before him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Sir you are a Gentleman, and I muſt beg my laſt favour from you, that ſince you are reſolved that I muſt dye, you would have pity upon my poor child here, and ſpare her life, and for this, Sir give me your hand:</hi> and thereupon ſtretching his hand towards the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el man, he had for a return, a very great blow with a Shable, which almoſt quite cut off his Hand, and the Villain redoubling his Stroak, gave him another violent Wound upon the left Eye, which cut him two Inches above it, and one below; this Stroak knocked him down, but getting up upon his Knees again, he ſaid, <hi>Gentlemen, it is now enough, you have done your work;</hi> and holding up his Hands (as well
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56751:44"/>as he could) to Heaven, he fervently cryed out, <hi>Lord Jeſus, have mercy on my Soul, and receive my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> While he was in this Poſture of Devotion, they wounded him in his Hands which he held up to Heaven, and in other parts of his Body, till in a kind of compoſure he laid down his Head upon his Arm, ſaying <hi>God forgive you, and I forgive you all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe were the laſt words which he uttered, like an excellent Chriſtian; after which they gave him no leſs then ſixteen Wounds on his Head; ſome of them as they were going away, thought they heard him groan, which made them go back, and to make ſure work, ſtir about his Brains in the Scull with the points of their Swords. His Head ſeemed to be all one Wound; and pieces of his ſhattered Scull, and Brains were ſome days after found on the Ground that Unhallowed <hi>Golgotha</hi> where he was ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Having finiſhed their long deſired Murther, they made his Servants Solemnly ſwear not to diſcover them, and then bad them in deriſion take up their Prieſt, and having ſaid ſo, rode back to <hi>Magus,</hi> where they firſt aſſaulted the Coach; and one of them, by Name <hi>John Balfour</hi> of <hi>Kinlock,</hi> as he paſſed by that Town, was heard to ſay very audibly and diſtinctly, <hi>That now Judas was killed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Proclamation being publiſhed in his Majeſties Name for the diſcovery of theſe abominable execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Murtherers, and ſearch made among the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Heritors of the Shire of <hi>Fife,</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Magus</hi> being examined upon oath; it was made apparent, that the bloody Aſſaſſins, and many others, who were ſtrongly preſumed to have been Abetters, and Contrivers of the Murther, were
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56751:44"/>notorious <hi>Fanaticks, Frequenters of Field-Conventicles, and Followers of Mr.</hi> Welſh, <hi>and other Traiterous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communed and Rebellious Preachers;</hi> Nine of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in this Tragedy were diſcovered by their Names and Sirnames, which are as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>John Balfour of Kinlock, David Hackſton of Rathilet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, George Balfour in Gilſton, James Ruſſel in Kings-Kettle, Robert Dingwall</hi> a Farmers Son in <hi>Caddam, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Guillan</hi> Weaver <hi>in Balmerinoch, Alexander Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon and Andrew Hinderſon, Sons to John Hinderſon in Killbrachmont, George Fleming, Son to George Fleming in Balbuthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The rebellion interrupting the courſe of Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe miſcreants for ſome time, the <hi>20th</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> 1679, there was another Proclamation publiſhed for the apprehending thoſe Nine, and all others that were in the Rebellion, and were Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>But by this time the Murtherers and Rebels, had fled the Kingdom, notwithſtanding all imaginable care and diligence to prevent their eſcape; and whilſt the Covenanting Army lay at <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> one of the <hi>Balfours,</hi> as a very credible Gentleman, who was then the Town, told me (ſaith my Author) openly boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Murther as a glorious fact; and ſaid hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Arm, <hi>This hand helped to kill the Fox.</hi> And five of the Accomplices, Complotters and Abetters of the Murther, choſe to dye, and be hung up in Chains upon the place, rather then confeſs the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the action, by acknowledging it was a Murther or a Sin.</p>
                     <p>The Fanatical Party, foretold it in ſeveral places, and the Morning before it was committed, one of the Aſſaſſins like a Jeſuit Conſecrated to an Heroical Act, after a ſolemn Sacrilegious form, held up his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56751:45"/>hand, and ſwore, that <hi>That hand ſhould kill the Arch-Prelate;</hi> upon which the Holy Siſter his Hoſteſs, kiſſed him. And it is notoriouſly known in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he, who commanded the foot for Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> upon <hi>Reupar Law (that famous Field Conventicle)</hi> owned that their Friends thanked God for the Archbiſhops death, which neither they nor their abetters in either Kingdom will call Murther, when they have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Speak thereof.</p>
                     <p>My Author goes further, and ſhews how the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors of theſe Godly Cut-throats <hi>Norman Leſly, John Leſley, Peter Carmichael</hi> and <hi>James Meluil</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinated Cardinal <hi>Beton</hi> Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in his Caſtle there in cold blood, gravely, and with the preface of an harangue; which <hi>Knox</hi> commends, calling the Principal Murtherer, <hi>a Meek man of God:</hi> an odd kind of Presbyterian meekneſs which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not commend.</p>
                     <p>From thence he deſcends, and ſhew their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples both Anicent and Modern, upon which they build theſe bloody practiſes. He tells as Goodman <hi>Knox</hi>'s Companion in his Diſcourſe of Tyranny and Popery, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. hath theſe words, <hi>All men are bound to ſee the Laws of God kept, and to ſuppreſs and reſiſt Idolatry by force.</hi> Nor is it ſufficient for Subjects not to obey the wicked Commands of Princes; <hi>but they muſt reſiſt them, and deliver the Children of God out of the hands of their Enemies, as we would deliver a Sheep that is indanger to be devoured by a Wolf.</hi> And if the Magiſtrates refuſe to put Maſſ-mongers and Falſe Preachers (now all Biſhops and Church-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in their eſteem are ſuch) to death, the people <hi>in ſeeing it performed,</hi> ſhew that zeal of God which was commended in <hi>Phineas.</hi>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56751:45"/>
                     <p>Hence all Kirk Writers ſince his Majeſties Return, ſuch as <hi>Napthali, Jus populi, The Apologetical Narration, The Poor mans Cup, The Hiſtory of the Indulgence</hi> (as he tells us) call the Biſhops <hi>Apoſtates, Perjured Prelates, a perjured Fraternity; Traitors to Chriſt, Enemies to his people, Idolaters, Backſliders.</hi> All which is meant of forſaking the Covenant, and Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is the very Language they murthered the Archbiſhop with; which ſhews they were not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits but arrant Presbyterians that did the Wicked fact; and my ſaid Author quotes this Paſſage from <hi>Jus Populi, pag.</hi> 415. <hi>The fact of</hi> Phineas <hi>was a Laudable Act of juſtice, and a precedent for Judges and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in all times coming, and that by his Example any Member of the Council (for Phineas roſe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Congregation) might lawfully riſe up and execute judgment on this wicked Wretch (the Archbiſhop) and his curſed Fraternity, who have brought by their Apoſtacy and defection from the Covenant, and cauſe of God, the wrath of God upon the Land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the reſt, I ſhall refer my Reader to that ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author, from whom I had not Tranſcribed all this, but to prompt others to read him, and to Supply that Defect to them who cannot get that Book.</p>
                     <p>The news of this Execrable and Barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was ſoon diffuſed all over <hi>England,</hi> and it may be all the reſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and entertained by all People who were not poiſoned with this Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Leven, with horror and deterſtation. The reſt began to qualify and allay it, with ill Characters of the poor man; or to divert it from the right Agents, by laying it one while upon the Jeſuits, and another while upon the Tenants of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop.</p>

                     <p>But they foreſaw theſe things would not do their buſineſs, and therefore their friends in <hi>London</hi> did what they could to inſtigate an Addreſs againſt the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> which was the man they moſt hated and feared of all the world, and who if he were not removed would certainly proſecute and revenge this Murther; now ſo it fell out, that though not upon their ſollicitation, there was an Addreſs Voted the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> which paſs'd the Eighth.</p>
                     <p>The Addreſs which I think fit to be inſerted here was as followeth.</p>

And the Proclamation publiſhed the day after the fact, for the diſcovery and apprehending of the Aſſaſſines, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Act (as it deſerved with great deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) had further allarm'd the whole Party; who had as they thought, no other way to eſcape the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved revenge, but by juſtifying the Murther with a Rebellion. And finding by this Addreſs, that the Houſe of Commons in <hi>England</hi> were in this critical moment, preſſing upon their dreadful Enemy the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> they took it for granted, God had eſpouſed their cauſe; and if they could make a head in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they ſhould be ſeconded out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hoping perhaps to be as well rewarded for this, as they were for beginning the former Rebellion,

So that all manner of outrages have been moſt arbitrarily exerciſed upon us through a tract of ſeveral years paſt; particularly in the year <hi>1678,</hi> by ſending among us an Armed Hoſt of Barbarous Savages, contrary to all Laws and Humanity; and by laying on us ſeveral Impoſitions and Taxes, as formerly. So of late by a meeting of Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Over-awed Members in the Convention of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates in <hi>July 1678,</hi> for keeping up of an Armed Force intruſted (as to a great part of it) into the hands of avowed Papiſts, or favourers of them; by whom ſundry Invaſions have been made upon us, and moſt exorbitant abuſes, and incredible Inſolencies committed againſt us, and we being continually ſought after, while meeting in Houſes for divine Worſhip, Miniſters and People frequently apprehended, and moſt rigorouſly uſed; and ſo being neceſſitated to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Lords Ordinances in Fields, in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart places; and there alſo often hunted out, and aſſaulted, to the effuſion of our bloud, and killing

At one of which Meetings, upon the firſt of <hi>June</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Captain <hi>Graham</hi> of <hi>Claver</hi> Houſe, being Warranted by a late Proclamation, to kill whomever he found in Arms, at Field Conventicles, making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, did furiouſly aſſault the people aſſembled; and further to provoke, did cruelly bind like Beaſts, a Miniſter, with ſome others, whom he had that very ſame Morning found in Houſes: and ſeveral being kill'd on both ſides; they knowing certainly, that <hi>by Law</hi> they behoved (if apprehended) to die; they did ſtand to their own defence, and continue together; and there after many of our Friends and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being under the ſame oppreſſion, expecting the ſame meaſure, did freely offer their aſsiſtance.

                     <p>I have taken the pains to tranſcribe this Long De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, not for any delight I take in it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an undeniable inſtance and demonſtration, that the Kirk-men in <hi>Scotland</hi> did then intend to have renewed that War again that formerly brought this Nation to the very brink of Ruine, and was the means of the Barbarous Murther of his Majeſties Father, of the Baniſhment of our King and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſters for twelve years; of the expence of 48 Millions of Money and Plate, and of the loſs of one hundred thouſand Lives by Fire, Sword and Famine: All which calamities were begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by theſe very men firſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the incouragement of ſome factious men of our own Nation, and afterwards here in <hi>England,</hi> upon the ſame pretences. As any man may remember that is but fifty years old, and the reſt may ſee by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Declaration with thoſe that were made then; and therefore I cannot but admire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in preventing this Presbyterian Plot, by a Prorogation in the very nick of time, without which this Rebellion would in all likely-hood have had much countenance from ſome in <hi>England,</hi> who encouraged it Underhand, upon pretences of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from above, how groundleſs ſoever; nor had it ended as it did, and where it did, if they had got the firſt battel, or but been able to have kept the Field.</p>
                     <p>But for the benefit of my Country Reader, who is not acquainted with the affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> let me obſerve two or three things for the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Grand Cheat, and without which this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56751:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>Story may leave great impreſſions of pity upon the mind of an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, which theſe bloudy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of all the world do not deſerve.</p>
                     <p>The Reader then ſhall be pleaſed to underſtand, that beſides this Rebellion; there was a former one at <hi>Pentland</hi> Hills, where theſe Covenanteers fought the Kings Forces in ranged Battel in 1666, and in many of their Field Conventicles, there was weekly Meetings of Hundreds and Thouſands of Armed men formed into Troops and Companies, ready upon all occaſions of probable capacity to fight againſt the King, for the King in <hi>Sion.</hi> And in 1676, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo numerous, that the Privy Council of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> adviſed his Majeſty to ſend <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces to lie in readineſs upon the Borders, and to order Viſcount <hi>Granard</hi> to lie with an Army on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coaſts, ready to be tranſported upon occaſion; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the Motion of the Marqueſs of <hi>Athol,</hi> to procure the Lords of the <hi>Highlands</hi> a Commiſſion to march with their Vaſſals under the Command of his Majeſties Major General into the Weſt, which deſcent of the <hi>Highlanders</hi> is mentioned in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and Aggravated beyond truth or reaſon, by ſtilling them Barbarians; which thoſe that knew theſe men aver they were not, (but behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very civilly) to prevent the Field Conventicles from running together into a general Rebellion; as they did this <hi>May.</hi> But to come to particulars, they had a Field faſt near <hi>Iedburgh</hi> in <hi>Tiveotdale</hi> toward the latter end of <hi>March</hi> 1678, where there were preſent 7 Preachers and 5000 people (the men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed) to ſeek God for three things. 1. <hi>That he would be pleaſed to put an end to the perſecution of his people in that Kingdom. 2ly, That he would have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56751:53"/>mercy on all thoſe that took the wicked Bond, (that was not to ſuffer any Conventicles on their Lands) and give them grace to repent. 3ly, That he would bleſs with ſucceſs thoſe Noble Lords that were gone to</hi> London (<hi>to complain of the Duke of</hi> Lauderdale, <hi>and who procured the firſt Addreſs againſt him, though to no purpoſe.</hi>) There was another in the <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where were aſſembled eight or 9000 People to receive the Sacrament, and renew the ſolemn League and Covenant, of which the Privy Council gave his Majeſty an account. And another near <hi>Dumbar</hi> ſhortly after, where they fell upon the Kings forces of the <hi>Baſſe,</hi> that went out to diſmiſs them; and killed one of the Souldiers, and wounded more. Finally, my Author who is a learned Gentleman, ſaith, <hi>if he ſhould go on to enumerate all the Field Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, till that great one, which began the Rebellion this</hi> May, <hi>he might write a Hiſtory.

                     <p>The matter of fact being thus ſtated, the Reader need not wonder they were ſeverely treated, when they ſuffered the pains of Treaſon and Rebellion; but beſides thoſe, they had committed a vaſt number of Maſſacres and Aſſaſſinations before they murthered the Primate, and this aggravated their ſufferings. Now all the cunning of this Declaration lies in this, that they tell us what they ſuffered; and perhaps tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not a tittle of the caſe. Which is juſt as if all the Rogues in the Nation, ſhould joyn and pen a complaint, ennumerating how many of them, ſince his Majeſties Return, have been Hanged, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, Whipped, Branded, Tranſported, Pillored,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56751:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>Impriſoned, which never meant any hurt to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty or the Government, but only to get a Living the beſt and eaſieſt way they could. Now to one that is as little vers'd in our ways of Puniſhment as we are in the <hi>Scotch,</hi> it would ſeem a rueful Story; whileſt an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man would ſmile, as knowing why they ſuffered all theſe hardſhips. I need not apply it, but ſhall add this, they have deſerved ten times more then they have felt, as being the bloudieſt Cut-throats in the world. So that in <hi>Scotland</hi> no man dare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them openly for fear of aſſaſſination, but ſuch as either muſt by the neceſſity of their places, or elſe have good means of defending their Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                     <p>Next I obſerve this Declaration is nothing but a large flouriſh upon the Speech, and drawn juſt at that looſe general rate which that is, calling thoſe Taxes and Puniſhments Arbitrary, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg were according to ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and then pretending the perſons that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their Parliaments or States, are overawed. But then I muſt commend their ingenuity in this, that they do not (with the Commons of <hi>England</hi>) lay the blame of all this upon the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> or their Miniſters, but upon the total change of their Government and State both Sacred and Civil, and upon the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the King; whom they ſupplicate with menaces to reſtore him into the ſame State he found them in; without which they were ſenſible, the removing of the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> or any other of the great Miniſters of State would ſignify nothing as to their Deſigns: which was as they plainly tell us, to ſet up the Presbyterian Doctrine and Church Government, to ſerve the King in nothing elſe, any further then he would ſerve them
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56751:54"/>in that. And laſtly to obtain a free and unlimited Parliament and Aſſembly, that is ſuch as it might not be in his Majeſties power to diſſolve or fruſtrate by prorogation; till they had extirpated Popery and Prelacy both together, which was freely and round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tell us what they would have, without cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and amuſing us with general terms and hints, but then I muſt not deny they had ſwords by their ſides to juſtify theſe demands, which our Gentlemen want, and I wiſh ever may do; but yet the Reader may obſerve that Speech that was ſo hugged in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Declaration meant the ſame thing, though in different terms.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve alſo, that they call <hi>the Presbyterian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Government,</hi> the Religion eſtabliſhed; though they own it to be taken away by a reſciſſory Act of Parliament; for they believe all thoſe Acts that have or ſhall be made againſt it, are Null and Void, and the former Acts are ſtill in force though repealed: which is an odd ſort of Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſting in the fancy of the people that own it, and not in Law or Nature.</p>
                     <p>They lay the ſtreſs of their Juſtification upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and yet own the greateſt part of it to ariſe from hence; that they muſt be deprived of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached by the faithful Miniſters, and be made Slaves, if they did not rebel. Now as to their civil intereſt, they would be in the ſame State with their Country men, who are ſo far from rebelling, that they have ſeveral times chaſtiſed them for it, with a very little aſſiſtance from <hi>England.</hi> And as to their Preachments, I wonder in what part of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel they learned to defend Chriſts Religion by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56751:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>but we muſt know this is pure <hi>Scotch,</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical, Jeſuitical Doctrine, begun by the Devil and his Vicar the Pope, not many hundred years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: and for which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges, there is neither Precept nor Example in the Bible, nor in all Church Hiſtory till near a thouſand years after our Saviour's time; and he gives this reaſon why the Goſpel taught patience and ſubmiſſion, becauſe the contrary would have ruined Chriſtianity then, when but a few profeſſed it, but tells us St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have taught otherwiſe if he had lived in our days. I ſhall not diſpute how the Cardinal or the <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentlemen (who talk at the ſame rate) came to know this, but I ſay, it is equally deſtructive of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Doctrine a man hath no mind to practiſe; as of this of ſubmiſſion to Princes, and ſuffering patiently for the truth without reſiſtance. As ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have a mind to revenge, and they tell me of the Doctrine of meekneſs, and forgiving injuries and Enemies; if I reply, this Doctrine was adopted to the Infant ſtate of Chriſtianity, when Profeſſors were few, and expoſed to perſecution, and could have got nothing by revenging their quarrels but ruine; but the ſtate of things is otherwiſe now, and I may revenge my ſelf with ſecurity both as to my ſelf, and as to my Religion; and from thence infer that that Doctrine is ceaſed, and I am at liberty to do in that particular as I ſee cauſe; and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have taught ſo if he had lived in theſe times, I ſay if I ſhould argue thus upon their principles, it could never be anſwered; and a man might ſay as much for any other Goſpel precept, he had no mind to obey.</p>

                     <p>But to return. The Covenanters in their firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, date the riſe of all their troubles from the year 1648, and that is true and worth a Note. You muſt know <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt had given them by the pacification all that they asked, and the long Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel Parliament had ſent them home loaden with thanks, Money and the ſpoils of <hi>England</hi> before our wars began<note n="*" place="margin">A View of the late Troubles. <hi>cap. 18.</hi>
                        </note>, but things going ill on the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſide, after the King had routed <hi>Waller</hi> in the Weſt, and almoſt totally ſubdued the North by the valour of the E. of <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> the Parliament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other way to turn them, were forced to call in the <hi>Scots</hi> once more with Money and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yea and Oaths too, to ſettle the Presbyterian Church Government here in <hi>England.</hi> Theſe two things prevailing upon them, in they came, and that ruined the King and his Party, who at laſt ſurrendring himſelf to the <hi>Scots,</hi> they dutifully ſold him to the Parliament for 300000 <hi>lb.</hi> as all the World knows; but the Chapmen fell out, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency prevailing at the ſame time in <hi>England,</hi> on it went with the ſame force, and ruined the poor Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and made this Covenanting Nation, the verieſt Slaves in the world; and ever ſince, Presbytery there as well as in <hi>England</hi> have been in a feeble ſtate: and they were oppreſt in their civil Intereſts, Liberties and Freedoms, and made ſuch Slaves by a ſtanding Army of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and two Forts which his Majeſty hath ſince demoliſhed, that a <hi>Scot</hi> in thoſe days durſt not have walked (as I have been told) with a Cudgel in his hand, and Parliament, general Aſſembly, or any other Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were never to have more, nor any other Addreſs but what they got <hi>by moſt humble Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only they had no Biſhops, ſo that if his Majeſty ſhould
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56751:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>reſtore all things as he found them, when God brought him home to his Crown and Kingdoms,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> would have no reaſon to thank him for the favour.</p>
                     <p>But in the interim, I wonder they can reflect thus upon the time, when their calamities began, which was the very year they ſold his Majeſties Father into the hands of his Enemies, who baſely murthered him; and not be confounded with horror and ſhame at the Villany they then did; nor yet reflect upon the Juſtice of God which hath purſued them ever ſince through all the changes that have happened, and having firſt made their dear Covenanting Brethren of <hi>England</hi> to begin the Chaſtiſement of them, hath gone on from time to time, to baffle all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to recover their Loſt Eſtate; and they have reaſon to believe he will do ſo, till the opinions and perſons of that ſchiſmatical Confederacy be rooted out of the World.</p>
                     <p>And here let our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters too be pleaſed to remember, they have done worſe then the <hi>Scots;</hi> for they murthered that Prince which the <hi>Scots</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold, and by how much they have ſmarted leſs then the <hi>Scots,</hi> ſo much the more is behind, and the Juſtice of God will not be reſtrained by the Act of Indemnity, but he will certainly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe them according to their deſerts, with ſo much the greater ſeverity, becauſe they have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lenity of his Anointed and his long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall add but one word more, and then ſee the Cataſtrophe of theſe Rebells; and that is an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Requeſt to the Loyal <hi>Scots,</hi> that they would
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56751:56"/>not take this amiſs, for I heartily applaud their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his Majeſty, and acknowledge they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to partake of his Royal bounty and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favour equally with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and I wiſh them all that proſperity and happineſs they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: for they are no otherwiſe concerned in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters, then the Church of <hi>England</hi> men are in the evil Actions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſſenters.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> who went Poſt into <hi>Scotland</hi> for that Service, went to the Army which the Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him, which lay then at a place called <hi>Blackburn,</hi> where he viewed and muſter'd all the Forces, and put all things in a readineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp, the next day he marched with his Army to <hi>Moorhead,</hi> and the day following to <hi>Bothwell</hi> bridge. Where the Enemy lay about eight Miles diſtant from his ſecond Camp.</p>
                     <p>The place where they then were, was called <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> Park, and was well choſen, if it had or could have been well defended; for there was no paſſage to it but over <hi>Bothwell</hi> bridge, which they had well lined with Muſqueteers, and Barricadoed with Stones, Cart Wheels, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes Army marched in great ſilence and Order, and had been upon the Rebels before they had taken the Allarm; but that their foremoſt Guards diſcovered them by the light of their Matches. And ſo they put themſelves into a poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:56751:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <p>The Duke found the Rebels in two Bodies, half a Mile one from the other; the foremoſt Party which was the weakeſt in Number, lay near the Bridge, the other near their Camp, as high as the liitle Park; where they ſtood in their Orders and Ranks.</p>
                     <p>Major <hi>Oglethorp,</hi> poſted himſelf upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near the Bridge, with the Dragoons, and the reſt of the Dukes Army drew up, upon a Hill fronting <hi>Hamilton</hi> Park, about a mile from the Bridge; the River being between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the Duke came to Major <hi>Oglethrop</hi>'s Poſt, there came out to him from the Rebels, one <hi>David Haine,</hi> and another of their Preachers, who preſented to his Grace, the Declaration I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Printed, and a Petition ſigned by <hi>Robert Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> their General, in the name of the Covenanted Army then in Arms; in which they prayed <hi>that the Terms of their Declaration might be made good, and that a ſafe Conduct might be granted to ſome of their Number, to addreſs themſelves to his Grace in this Matter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which the Duke replyed, <hi>that he would not treat with them upon their Declaration, the terms of which were contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Land, and ſuch as he would not, nor could grant;</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were too high to have been offered after a Victory; much more in the firſt approaches of a General, with a better though ſmaller Army then theirs. But then he told them, <hi>that if they would lay down their Armes, he would receive them into the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56751:57"/>Kings mercy.</hi> And with this Anſwer the two Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers went back, deſiring ſome time to conſider; which the Duke granted them.</p>
                     <p>About half an hour after, the Rebels ſent a Paper by a Drummer, repreſenting that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that his Grace came from <hi>England,</hi> with terms to be offered to them, and they deſired to know what he had to propoſe, that they might adviſe whether the Terms were ſuch as they could accept of.</p>
                     <p>Whether this were ſo or no, it was very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in them, to ſend this Meſſage before they had excuſed themſelves in relation his firſt demands; and beſides, this was a mighty ſlight to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to demand an account of his private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions by a Drummer with a Paper; when as it had been fitter to have ſent two or three of the beſt Gentlemen in their Army to have asked this favour, with all the Courtſhip imaginable; though their Forces had been much ſtronger then they were. For this indeed was it that made them thus inſolent, their Preachers had doubtleſs informed them, that the Dukes Army was leſs then theirs; as it is ſaid it was. And hence they concluded very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, they might ask what they pleaſed, and have it.</p>
                     <p>The Duke was not idle all this while, but had ordered his Cannon to be brought down from the Body of the Army, and Planted near the Bridge, and with them he had Drawn down ſome part of his Horſe and Foot, whilſt they were treating, and took no notice of what he did, or at leaſt did not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56751:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>oppoſe it, ſo they were every moment in a worſe condition and he was in a worſe condition, and he in a better.</p>
                     <p>So that being netled with this contempt of theirs, he ſent away their Drummer with this anſwer, <hi>that ſince they had not ſatisfied him, but rather trifled, he would receive no more meſſages from them.</hi> And to ſhew them he was in Earneſt, whatever they were, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Cannon to fire; which it no ſooner did, but the Rebels who were drawn up on the other ſide upon a riſing ground near the Bridge, threw themſelves upon the ground to avoid the ſhot. But thoſe that were placed upon the Bridge, fired at firſt pretty briskly, but after five or ſix Cannon ſhot they ran away, thoſe on the riſing ground beginning firſt; as they were a ſort of tumultuous people fitter to begin then carry on a War.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes men immediately ſeized the Bridge, and threw into the River their Barracadoes; where they took the only piece of Cannon they had, of which they had made no uſe; and then followed them up the Hill: but their Number being very ſmall, the Rebels rallied, and faced them, but had not the courage to come down upon them. So the Dukes Party returned back again to the Bridge, and one ſhot of Cannon more, made the Rebels flie to their main Body, where they ſtood again. By which, one may ſee here was neither courage nor conduct in theſe men or their Commanders.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the General paſſed the Army o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bridge, and drew it up upon the riſing ground which took ſome time, and at laſt a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were quite in Order, the Rebels advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon the Army in very good order; but eſpying
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56751:58"/>the Cannon in the head of the Dukes Army, they immediately ſhifted their Order and opened in the middle, thinking it ſeems they were obliged to ſhoot ſtreight forward, but the Cannon being turn'd upon them as they then ſtood, and diſcharged three or four times, they began to run again; their Commander <hi>Robert Hamilton</hi> being one of the firſt; and the Dukes Dragoons and the Highlanders Advancing upon them in this Confuſion, it was a perfect Rout, and they fled all ways; the Dukes men purſuing them. In this Skirmiſh there were killed 7, or 800, and Eleven or 1200 taken Priſoners. The Horſe were wholly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and thoſe of the Foot that eſcaped, fled immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Wood in <hi>Hamilton</hi> Park; where the only care was to ſecure them from flying. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Grace drew up his Forces, and ſurrounded the Park, and ſent Collonel <hi>Duglas</hi> with a detacht Party to ferret them out of the Wood. Of the Dukes Party few men were loſt.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the Duke ſent out ſeveral Parties to purſue thoſe that were fled; marching him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Army to a Village within two miles of <hi>Streuine;</hi> and the twenty fourth of <hi>June,</hi> ſent all the priſoners which were ſaid to be 11, or 1200, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guard of two Militia-Regiments, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Strathan</hi>'s Troop of Dragoons to <hi>Edenborough;</hi> the Magiſtrates of which place, undertook to ſecure them with the Town Guards; and accordingly put them into an incloſure with high Walls round it, at the Back of the <hi>Gray Fryers</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>The next day, the Duke returned to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> to conſult with the Lords of the Council how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Heretors and Militia-Regiments that had
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56751:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſerved his Majeſty on that occaſion againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, as alſo of thoſe that were then on their march from the ſeveral Shires; ſeeing there was then no need of their further Service. Which affair being ordered, together with ſuch other as he thought moſt neceſſary, he took Poſt-Horſes, and returned to <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus ended the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebellion, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fate of ſuch ill grounded enterpriſes; it made them weaker and more hated, and ſtrengthened and confirmed the lawful Authority of his Majeſty; it being the nature of the Vulgar to loath and deſpiſe the Innocent when unfortunate; much more Rebels and Traitors.</p>
                     <p>But then theſe Zealots like their Predeceſſors who ruined the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us, by their cruelty and furious bloody devotion, had beſpoke the deteſtation of all ſober men; not only by their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous aſſaſſination of the Primate, which was the occaſion of this Rebellion, but alſo by their inſolence and unaccountable rage and madneſs during the ſhort time it laſted. Of which I will give a few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

                     <p>And now my dear Country men, if you will but be pleaſed to reflect ſeriouſly and impartially upon what I have written with great pains for your infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; I doubt not but you will conclude with me; that as never any Prince treated a People with more Candour and Lenity then his Majeſty did upon this juncture, ſo there were ſome that made very unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table returns to his goodneſs; and plainly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the peace of the Kingdom, was not ſo truly aimed at by ſome of them, as it was intended by him. Notwithſtanding their loud pretences of preſerving and ſettling the Proteſtant Religion, which is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably annexed to, and bound up in the other.</p>
                     <p>How far they imploy'd their time in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Nation, how far their Proceedings were calm and peaceable, and how far they tended to the curbing of the motions of thoſe unruly Spirits which did endeavour to diſturb them, I ſhall leave alſo to your and their ſerious thoughts.</p>
                     <p>I have all along followed the Printed Journal of this Seſſion of Parliament, tranſcribing for the moſt part the very words; except they were too long, and then abbreviating them with all the fidelity ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: but when all is done, I adviſe you to read the Original too.</p>

                     <p>THis and the two former Parts of this Work were all written at once, tho they have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince to be publiſhed at ſeveral times, and were occaſioned by thoſe many Generous and moſt Loyal Demonstrations you every day then gave of your Attachment to His Majeſties Intereſt, and the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government both in Church and State; for the truth is, till I ſaw you riſe up ſo generally, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ſo heartily what your intentions were, I durſt not think of oppoſing that Torrent, that then ſeemed to bear down all that ſtood before it, and threatned the rooting up of the Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>But when you came forth, and with a Loyalty and Courage becoming <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> tell your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign however you have of late been repreſented to him and the World, you were reſolved to maintain His Royal Authority, the Church and the Government,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:56751:63"/>and the Lawful Succeſſion too, in the State they were now Legally ſetled, againſt all oppoſition whatſoever, and to that purpoſe freely and ſincerely offer him your Lives and Fortunes to Command when neceſſity ſhould require; I then ſaw there were more Thouſands then I thought of that were reſolved never to bow the Knee to the ſchiſmatical Calves either at <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Bethel;</hi> or ſubmit to another <hi>Hogan Mogan</hi> Common-wealth; and then I perceived that my former fears, how juſt ſoever they might ſeem before, were yet too great, for there were (or at leaſt might be) more for us then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
                     <p>But then when I conſidered your quality, and the places you enjoyed in the Government, I raiſed my hopes yet higher, and I concluded a people who had ſuch Loyal, ſuch Religious, ſuch Free and Generous Perſons intruſted with the Government of them, could hardly miſcarry in the end, tho for a time popular Storms might toſs them.</p>
                     <p>I thought alſo that God himſelf had again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected his beloved Daughter the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for which I was before more concern'd then for my ſelf: and that he had declared himſelf the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time for the Family of his Servant the Illuſtrious Royal Martyr; For I could not aſcribe ſo univerſal and unuſual Concurrence of Men of different Humors, Educations, and degrees to any other cauſe then the
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:56751:63"/>Divine Providence inſpiring them with a Spirit of Unity, Loyalty, and Reſolution.</p>
                     <p>Yet obſerving that there was a conſiderable number of Freemen and Freeholders in the Nation to whom Heaven had not yet vouchſafed that favour, who went wrong out of Ignorance and incogitancy rather then Faction or Diſloyalty, and being an idle perſon, I thought I could not poſſibly better imploy a part of my time, then in <hi>Addreſſing</hi> to them, to reduce and inform them, and as much as in me lay to render them like you; and alſo to confirm ſuch as might poſſibly yet ſtagger if another Temptation ſhould befall them.</p>
                     <p>So that <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> is was from your example, I took Courage to Write, and for your ſakes Chiefly have I ſince ventured to publiſh what I have written, that I may in ſome ſort juſtify your Numerous <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes,</hi> and therefore I humbly beg your leave to Dedicate the whole Work to you who indeed firſt gave it life.</p>
                     <p>It may poſſibly ſeem ſtrange to ſome of you to find an Epistle Dedicatory in the end,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Euſebius</hi> puts the Dedication of his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the tenth and laſt Book of it.</note> as it were of a Work; but the thing hath been done before, and the truth is, I would not venture at a Dedication till I did ſee whether it would be received in the World, and now it is, I am ſorry I have nothing better to preſent you with whoſe Names deſerve to be Regiſtred to all ſucceeding Ages, and your <hi>Encomium</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:56751:64"/>by the moſt Elegant Pen the Chriſtian World affords.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> it is not my deſign to Create a high opinion of you, in your ſelves, but to excite you to go on and perfect the good Work you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, for that is the thing the Factious pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, <hi>viz.</hi> That however you ſeem now, when time ſhall be, you will unſay all again, and joyn with them as heartily as any other againſt the Church and State, and this they have publiſhed in print; and that I may not ſeem to ſlander them, I will Tranſcribe the very words of one of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="margDblQuotes">No applications of this Nature to the reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant perſon are to be eſteemed of any great Weight or Significancy;<note place="margin">An Impartial Account of the Nature and Tendency of the late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</note> if you do but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſult of the many Addreſſes Three and Twenty years ago to <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> and how they only ſerved to render him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure till he was undermined and ſupplanted, for all the Sixteen Hundred Thouſand that vowed to live and dye by him, not ſo much as one man drew a Sword for him when he came to be laid aſide. I acknowledg that there is great difference betwixt an Uſurper and a lawful Prince,</q> (he might have added alſo, and betwixt a parcel of men that had ſworn and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn themſelves as often as occaſion required, and
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:56751:64"/>betrayed thereby all parties one after another, and ſuch Addreſſors as theſe who applyed themſelves to their lawful and rightful Soveraign to whom they were true when his <hi>1600000</hi> Rebelled, firſt againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Prince, and when they had prevailed againſt him by Perjury and Violence, they made uſe of them one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, till at length they ruined themſelves too) <q rend="margDblQuotes">Yet that <hi>(as he goes on)</hi> detracts very little in the preſent Caſe from the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Conſideration which I have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, ſeeing the leaſt that we are to gather from it is this, that no Addreſſes contrary to the Intereſt and general Humour of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>(which he ſuppoſeth theſe were)</hi> are to be accounted of any value for a Prince to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain himſelf upon. And if there be nothing elſe to ſecure our late Addreſſors to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty <hi>(which he grants there is, they being his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subjects, and ever Loyal to him)</hi> but their promiſes and proteſtations in theſe papers, he may be as much diſappointed, ſhould he truſt to them, as the former Gentleman after the like Security.</q> Thus far my Author, but he ought to have conſidered, <hi>Richard</hi> was turn'd out by the Army againſt whom theſe Addreſſors could not have protected him if they would, which added to the former of the temper of the different Addreſſors to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:56751:65"/>the ſeveral Parties, and their very diſtant or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſite poſitions, which he takes notice of, the one being an Uſurper, and the other a lawful Prince, will make the two caſes ſo totally unlike; that no conſequence can be drawn from the one to the other, much leſs that bold one, that becauſe <hi>Richard</hi> was laid aſide without any reſiſtance made by the Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, therefore none is to be expected from theſe.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, tho you be never ſo ſincere, yet you may be overpowred by force, and then all your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations in theſe Papers will have no other effect then to betray you to ruine when ever theſe Godly <hi>Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> can get the maſtery over you; to prevent which it is abſolutely neceſſary to back your ſaid Loyal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations with effectual ſupplies when neceſſity requires, and in the Interim to take all the care imaginable to win off as many as you can of the Freemen and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of the Nation from ſiding with ſuch men as my Author, in the next Election of Parliament-Men: and becauſe I could do little more, I writ theſe three ſmall diſcourſes for that end, and how meanly ſoever I have performed my part in it, I beg your acceptance of my good intentions, and that you would in your ſeveral Stations promote this Work which is ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, by more effectual means.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt which I am perſuaded none would ſucceed better then an Univerſal Execution of the Laws againſt
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:56751:65"/>the Diſſenters, Eſpecially thoſe againſt <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> for theſe are the Seed-places where factions are nurſed up till they may be strong enough to graple with and overturn the Government of Church and State, and to this end the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act would be more ſubſervient in Corporations, then that of the <hi>22d</hi> of his now Majeſties Reign. For if the Teachers were once removed out of theſe places, tho but to a diſtance of Five Miles, they would not ſo eaſily poyſon the ſmall Freemen with Rebellious principles; and thoſe that they have already ſeduced would in time become more tractable.</p>
                     <p>One other means I would recommend to you, is the Communicating the Loyal diſcourſes that are every day printed to your Neighbours, which is done much more uſually by the Diſſenters by the other ſort, ſo that you ſhall ſometimes find a Seditious Libel to have paſſed through ſo many hands, that it is at laſt ſcarce Legible for durt and ſweat; whilſt the Loyal anſwer ſtands in a Gentlemans Study as clean and as neat as it came from the Preſs. But if the meaner ſort of men might but hear both the Parties, the Advantage the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives to the Loyal ſide, added to the ſtrength of their Reaſons, would certainly in time turn the Scale that way; and then they would be zealous too for the Government, when their Reaſons and Conſciences were once convinced that their Intereſt and Duty lay there.</p>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:56751:66"/>
                     <p>And another is, the keeping (as much as is poſſible) of Factious men out of all places of Truſt, Power, or Profit; which when they have once gained, they conſtantly imploy theſe private advantages to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick dammage. Had this been duely Attended upon his Majesties Return, and practiſed ever ſince, we had not been in the danger we now are of being ruined the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time by them: but alas, they had plundred the Nation for <hi>20</hi> years together, and the Act of Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity made all this Ill-gotten wealth their own, and with it they purchaſed the far greateſt part of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of profit, whilſt the poor Caviliers were excluded becauſe they had nothing to give; and the rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a ſhame to take any thing of them. And thus the Factious with the ſpoils of the Royal Party put themſelves once more into a Capacity to ruin the Government, and having thus got much more wealth then they had before, they procured a great part of the places of Truſt and Authority to be put into their hands too, and many Loyal perſons turn'd Whigs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and out of diſcontent.</p>
                     <p>But that which of all other things would the moſt ſpeedily and effectually ſecure the Nation from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps into miſery and confuſion, is a ſurrender of the Charters of the Corporations into his Majeſties hands, and the taking out of new ones with ſuch reſtrictions as he and his Council thinks fit. Nor can I imagine
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:56751:66"/>why this ſhould be ſcrupled, it being the onely way that can ſecure them long in that Vaſt and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Priviledg they now have of ſending up Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes to the Parliament, which as they had it at firſt from the Crown, ſo it was in danger to have been lost when the Government fell into <hi>O. C's.</hi> Hands; and will go near to be loſt in the Next Rebellion, and therefore it befits them, of all men, to Secure the King's Authority, which is the foundation of theirs.</p>

<pb n="x" facs="tcp:56751:67"/>I will tranſcribe ſome Paſſages out of him, Section the 7th, he tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">The Number of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers <hi>(to the Addreſſes)</hi> is not to ſo Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to bear any proportion to thoſe who are againſt them; for tho' a few buſie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have made a great noiſe and buz in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of the Kingdom, yet all of them put together, make not ſo great a Number as we have ſeen not long ſince to one Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Parliament.</q> Now doubtleſs this his <hi>Neglect and Scorn of your Paucity and Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (as he words it) as it proceeds from hence, that you were for the moſt part the <hi>Governors,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Freemen</hi> or <hi>Freeholders</hi> that <hi>Addreſſed,</hi> when the <hi>Rabble</hi> and their Children <hi>Petitioned,</hi> ſo it is intended to provoke his Mirmidons to fall upon you, and teach you more respect to his <hi>Leviathan</hi> The Multitude.</p>
                     <p>This he proſecutes further, Section the <hi>8th,</hi> where he tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">Tho' the Clergy and many of the preſent Commiſſioners both Civil and Military, and the Magiſtrates of ſeveral of the Corporations had not onely Intereſted themſelves in Countenancing the Addreſſes, but been Sticklers for them as for the Great <hi>Charter</hi> or the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and ſome of them had been Knighted meerly for that

                     <p>Yet Section <hi>9th,</hi> he tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">Your quality was as Inconſiderable as your Number, being ſuch as for want of Years <hi>(their Party are always of Age if they can but tell their Names)</hi> or Poverty were never Capable of Giving a Vote in Election of Members to Sit in Parliament, and (a few excepted) the reſt made up of the Scum and Refuſe of the Places where they live.</q> Were all his Petitioners Worſhipful Gentlemen, Learned States-men and Lawyers, or Sound Divines, &amp;c. tho the Order was, Care ſhould be taken the Subſcribers ſhould be numerous, tho they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>Freemen?</hi> But he goes on, <q rend="margDblQuotes">
                           <hi>Norwich,</hi> whence we have been alaramed with the greateſt Noiſe, yields but a ſmall Number of perſons either of Eſtate or Uſefulneſs, whoſe hands were Annexed to the Paper which was ſent up.</q> Yet this ſmall number of Poor, Uſeleſ? people, were the Governors
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:56751:68"/>and Common Councel of one of the Richest as well as Loyalleſt Cities of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>Section the <hi>10th</hi> he ſaith, <q rend="margDblQuotes">That your Moral Conditions were agreeable to your Civil, men Popiſhly inclined. Abhorrers of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or guilty of one or other offence which the late Parliaments were about calling them to an Account for: the reſt were little Bankrupt Tradeſmen, Scandalous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced Attorneys: men whoſe folly made them pragmatical and impertinent, or whoſe prodigality and ambition forced them to look for preferment above their merit.

<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:56751:68"/>from this Character perceive what Treatment you muſt Expect from theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> if ever they get an Advantage againſt you.</p>
                     <p>Section the <hi>11th</hi> he tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">Your Politicks were equal with your Morals; for can any man believe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that the Mayors, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boroughs, Aldermen, Bailiffs, Burgeſſes and Freemen of <hi>Ripon, Wigan, Windſor, Chatham, Hazelmeere, New-Sarum,</hi> &amp;c. are Competent Judges what the late Houſe of Commons did legally or illegally? &amp;c.</q> Yet this is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo difficult, as 'tis to tell when it is fit a Parliament ſhould Sit, and when it is not fit, becauſe this depends on certain known and fixed Rules, which the other doth not, but is to be judged by the preſent ſtate of Forraign and Domeſtick Affairs; things that are known to few men. Then he goes on and tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">The Learned Gentlemen of the Gown were at leaſt as well qualified to give their ſence and opinion about theſe matters, as Country Mercers, Inn-Keepers, Taylors and Thatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</q> (You muſt know, the <hi>London</hi> Tradeſmen are next Neighbours to his Learned Gown-men, and ſo are Excepted by the Addition of the word <hi>Country.</hi>) And yet he tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">Thoſe refuſed to meddle with Addreſſes, &amp;c.</q> But, Sir, did any of them

                     <p>He Concludes, Sect. <hi>22.</hi> with this Threat, <q rend="margDblQuotes">That as you muſt Expect that the judgment which you have paſſed upon perſons and things, will at one time or another come under a review; So matters which have either been miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by you, or in reference to which Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments <hi>(you know which he means)</hi> have been Arraigned, may before then, come to be ſo well underſtood by his Majeſty, and all things ſo well Adjuſted between Him and his People, that you <hi>(the Addreſſers)</hi> may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find your ſelves able to decline, nor be in a condition to Control the Juriſdiction of the next Parliament, to which, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> he ſhall at preſent leave you.</q> And you may be ſure he expects it will be ſuch an One as the Laſt were, and then he thinks he ſhall not need to wiſh you a worſe puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>At this Inſolent rate you have been treated in Print, and what can follow but the Utmoſt Revenge this
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:56751:69"/>worſt ſort of Men can inflict upon you, if ever they get you again under their power. I have read, That in the end of the laſt War there was a Motion made at a Council of War, for a general Maſſacre of all the principal <hi>Malignants,</hi> as they then ſtiled the King's Party, and that it was Carried in the Negative by a few Votes; and Conſidering the Rage, Malice and Diſpair of theſe men to accompliſh their Trayterous Deſigns of Subverting the Government any other way, now the Kingdom hath taken the Alarm, and not only Addreſſed, but Abhorred their <hi>Aſſociation</hi> too, it is but reaſonable to Expect it will not be again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled if Ever they be in a Capacity to put it to the Vote the Second time: which God prevent.</p>
                     <p>My Intentions were to have ended this Epiſtle here, it being but too long already; but there is one Paſſage in this Pamphlet I judge abſolutely neceſſary to be Conſidered, the words are Theſe;<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>2.</hi>

                     <p>And in the firſt place it cannot be denyed, but that every man ought to have the Liberty to propoſe his own perſonal <hi>Wants, Fears and Dangers</hi> to his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and to be allowed thereupon to beg ſuch Redreſs as the Law hath provided: but then to infer from hence, that he hath an Equal right or ability to Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Publick and National <hi>Wants, Fears and Dangers,</hi> and to beg the <hi>Enacting of New Laws,</hi> or the Repeal of Old Laws, for the removing of them: or, which is all one, the Calling, or Sitting, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, or Changing, of Parliaments to that purpoſe, is ſo groſs a deluſion, ſo full of Danger, and doth ſo immediately tend to Sedition and Rebellion, Eſpecially if Multitudes of Factious men may be allowed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what <hi>Fears, Wants and Dangers,</hi> they pleaſe, and then in a Tumultuary way to beg what Redreſs they think fit, by Petitions ſigned by <hi>40, 50,</hi> or <hi>60</hi>

                     <p>As to the Second Propoſition, It is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That every one is not to be accounted Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualified to Determine concerning the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs and Legality of Parliamentary Proceedings and Reſolves; But then 'tis not fit to infer from thence, Firſt, That no man is ſo qualified; nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That it is impoſsible but that all their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould be Legal and Reaſonable. Nor Thirdly, That any man ought to approve of, and ſubmit to them, whether they be ſo or no. For tho it is most certain, there are but few men are ſo qualified; yet it is as Certain, that ſome men even amongst the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> were, if many Years Sitting in Parliament will qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie a perſon of great abilities for it: And it is no leſs certain,<note place="margin">That of 1640, 1649, 1653, 1656. in none of which, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the firſt, was there any Royal Writ at all. Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Speech, <hi>May</hi> the 8th, 1661.</note> That the Proceedings of Two or Three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments within the Memory of Man, have been not onely Unreaſonable and Illegal, but Trayterous and Rebellious; and we are not ſure <hi>but</hi> that we may have more ſuch, if God be not the Mercifuller to us: and if any ſuch ſhould happen to be, and we ſhould joyn with them, tho but out of a Modeſt Opinion that we are not ſufficiently qualified to Determine concerning
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:56751:71"/>the <hi>Legality</hi> and <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Proceedings</hi> and <hi>Reſolves;</hi> yet it would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excuſe the Guilt, nor prevent the Puniſhment that is due by Law to them who ſhall Rebel againſt the King, tho in Obedience to a Parliament.</p>
                     <p>To the Third, <hi>That no Number of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Impowred to Umpire betwixt his Majeſty and his Great Council;</hi> may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That there is an ambiguity in the word <hi>Umpire,</hi> and it may be taken not only different, but contrary wayes, and therefore it ought not to have been uſed in this place.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, That if any difference ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ariſe betwixt him and them, we ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the King, nor to aſsiſt his Great Council againſt him with Force and Arms, tho the King ſhould be in the Wrong, and they in the Right; for that is Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Parliament already.<note place="margin">13 Car. 2. cap. 6.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is true, That no Number of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever have any authority to hear and determine their Differences in a Judicial way, ſo as to compel them to ſubmit to their judgment; for then that Number of men ſhould be Superior both to King and Barliament; but all this notwithſtanding ſeeing the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Appealed to the People by Printing their Votes, &amp;c. and the King by publiſhing his Gracious <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> why might not the <hi>Addreſſers,</hi> ſo far ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:56751:71"/>of His Majeſties Proceedings, as to Thank Him for the Satisfaction he had given them, and to promiſe him to ſtand by him with their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which they were bound to do however.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It may be anſwered, That beſides the Differences betwixt the King and the Commons, and the Lords and Commons, there were ſome Differences betwixt the Commons and ſome of them that Addreſſed afterwards; they had Impriſoned ſeveral Gentlemen and other Subjects which they conceived then (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they do ſtill) were Illegal and unreaſonable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and they were as capable of Knowing their want of Protection, and as ſenſible of the Dangers, and Fears of further Oppreſsion as other men, and therefore they ought to have been Juſtified if they had begged thoſe means of <hi>Relief</hi> and <hi>Redreſs</hi> which the Law had provided for them; but yet they <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently</hi> and <hi>Silently</hi> Expected the Iſſue till <hi>GOD</hi> put it into His Mejeſties Royal Breaſt (in whoſe hands are the Hearts of Kings) to declare theſe their Proceedings <hi>ARBITRARY;</hi> and might they not then riſe up and Thank their Soveraign for the Favour he had ſhown them? It is hard to conceive upon this Man's principles they might not have Petitioned His Majesty for Relief and Redreſs before this time, but yet no man did it.</p>
                     <p>And in Relation to the Differences betwixt His
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:56751:72"/>Majeſty and the Commons, and the Upper and the Lower Houſe, what neceſsity is there that the Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers ſhould approve of them; for tho the Commons were their Repreſentatives and Truſtees, the King is their Soveraign, and the Lords are not Aliens and Foreigners, but the Two higheſt States of this our Native Country: and altho the <hi>Addreſſers</hi> pretend no Authority over that Supreme Court of Juriſdiction, yet what reaſon is there why they may not approve of what the Lords have done well, tho the Commons will not?</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole therefore I crave Leave to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That the <hi>Addreſſors</hi> in <hi>General</hi> have done nothing but what may be fairly Juſtified, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Satisfie his Majeſty and the World, that there was a Conſiderable Part of the Nation did not approve of what was done in the Names of the whole by the Commons in Parliament: and if it be the Duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Engliſh man to fight for his King, if occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, againſt any Party that ever ſhall hereafter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have the Authority of both or either of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to back them,<note place="margin">13 Car. 2. cap. 6.</note> as I humbly conceive is moſt plain, then why may not they right his Majeſty with their Pens, who muſt do it with their Swords; why may they not <hi>Approve</hi> his Cauſe as well as <hi>Defend it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if this be not allowed, Any King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> may be Depoſed and Murthered as the
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:56751:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>late King</hi> was; for if there be a <hi>Blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> due to all the <hi>Votes</hi> of Parliament,<note place="margin">13 Car. 2. cap. 1. §. 2.</note> and no man may in any Caſe judge them <hi>Illegal</hi> and <hi>Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable;</hi> then muſt all men abſolutely Submit to them, and obey them; and the Conſequence is, if any future Parliament ſhall <hi>Vote</hi> any future <hi>King,</hi> or or Monarchy it ſelf a <hi>Grievance</hi> to the Nation, and thoſe that ſtand by them Enemies to the Kingdom, if no man may Contradict ſuch a <hi>Vote,</hi> nor any Number of Men how great ſoever Umpire betwixt the King and his Great Council; that is, Defend him againſt his Parliament, the effect will Certainly follow; and as this is the natural Tendance of theſe Principles as we ſaw in the Late Troubles, ſo I can conceive no other cauſe why they ſhould be now again inſinuated into the Heads of the Rabble.</p>
                     <p>For theſe Men who pretend to reverence the Three Laſt Parliaments at ſuch a Prodigious rate,<note place="margin">The late Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament tho filled with <hi>Danby</hi> his Penſioners, The Modeſt Vindication of the Two laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> do tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce that which went immediately before most abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; and thoſe who are ſo tender of the Votes of theſe, care as little for the Eſtabliſhed Lawes of the former, as I do for the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or of the Synod of <hi>Dort:</hi> So that it is plain, it is not reſpect to Parliaments as Parliaments, that makes them thus obſequious; but as made up of ſuch a Sort of men, and Driving on ſuch Deſigns and Intereſts.</p>
                     <pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:56751:73"/>
                     <p>To return then, Gentlemen, from this long Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which I have inſerted only to Justifie You, I will Conclude, That as you have begun bravely, ſo you muſt go thro with the buſineſs, or Expect a Revenge from the Oppoſite Party equal to their Rage; and tho I Know you do not fear them, yet I would Adviſe you not to be too Secure of them, but let your Vigilance, Induſtry, and Application to all Sorts of Men, be equal to theirs at leaſt; and then it is Ten thouſand to one, you ſhall never try either theirs or your own Valour, and as your Caſe is better, ſo let it inspire you with more Reſolution to Stand and Fall with it; and his Moſt hearty Prayers for a good Succeſs upon all your Loyal Undertakings and Deſigns, ſhall never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who is</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56751:74"/>ſuch Secrecy and Quickneſs, that their Friends at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> could give them no previous Notice of his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo to do: So that beſides the total diſappointing them of all that Countenance, Ayd and Aſſiſtance they promiſed themſelves from <hi>England,</hi> many of their Friends at home, whoſe Crimes being leſs, had not the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or whoſe Zeal was not of that fiery temper with theirs, and therefore were prudently reſolved (tho they wiſhed well to the deſign) yet not to hazard their ſweet Lives and Fortunes in it till they ſaw what Succeſs theſe firſt Venturers had, who hearing of the Prorogation of the Parliament, and being doubtleſs admoniſhed by their <hi>London</hi> Friends at the ſame time not to ſtir during this ſhort Receſs, (as they then thought it would be) layd by all thoughts of Joyning with them and Augmenting their Numbers, and the Privy Councils in both Nations attending ſolely to that buſineſs, it was Extinguiſhed almoſt as eaſily as it began.</p>
                     <p>Upon which His Majeſty by his Royal Proclamation Diſſolved this Parliament, and Iſſued out Writs for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to Sit at <hi>Weſtminster</hi> the Seventeenth day of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1679. Hoping his Subjects duly reflecting upon the Miſcarriages of the Laſt Houſe of Commons, and the Danger the Nation had ſo narrowly eſcaped of Being involved in another deſtructive Inteſtine War, at a time when the Victorious Arms of <hi>France</hi> hung like a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cloud over our heads, and the High Diſcontents of the Popiſh Party, which were inflamed and inraged both by the Diſcovery and Proſecutions of the late Plot, lay broyling in the Bowels of the Nation, would proceed with more Prudence and Caution in the Next Elections, and ſend Him up men of Better Tempers, or that at leaſt theſe Gentlemen by that Act, ſeeing He was reſolved to keep the Reins in his own hands, and to let them Sir
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56751:74"/>or Diſſolve them according as they behaved themſelves, would thereby be kept in better awe for the future, and make uſe of a little more calmneſs in their Proceedings, if it were but to continue their Being.</p>
                     <p>But alas, His Majeſty ſoon found himſelf deceived in his Expectation, the common people who ſee with other mens eyes, and follow as they are led, and that is for the moſt part, the wrong way, were eaſily perſwaded to believe in the firſt place that this Parliament was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued and Diſſolved onely to prevent the Tryal of the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower;</hi> tho the Not Trying of them was one of the greateſt Cauſes that Moved his Majeſty to it, as appears plainly both by the Journals of both the Houſes, and his Majeſties Speech in the Concluſion of that Seſſion of Parliament; and altho theſe Five Lords were brought to the Bar, and the Commons ſummon'd to give in Evidence againſt them that very day that they were Prorogued, they refuſed to do it.</p>
                     <p>And on the other ſide, the Malecontents rejoyced greatly in it, being well aſſured that the ſame Men would be choſen again, and ſo made uſe of this Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as a means to incenſe the People againſt the King and the Government, and to increaſe the real or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended fears of Men by their Loud Clamours againſt <hi>French</hi> Penſioners, Popery, Arbitrary Government, and the like, which both in diſcourſe and Print (the Preſs being now at Liberty from its former reſtraint) they objected with equal Confidence and Falſhood againſt the Loyal Gentlemen that had oppoſed them.</p>
                     <p>But beſides theſe general Charges, they made ſpecial uſe of two things that fell out in the laſt Parliament, and that had a mighty influence upon the Minds of the populace and other Unthinking men. The firſt of which was to repreſent all thoſe Gentlemen of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56751:75"/>Houſe of Commons who had Voted againſt the Bill for Excluding his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as Papiſts, or at leaſt Popiſhly affected; and for my part, I believe it was the principal Motive of bringing in that Bill: for it is ſcarce poſſible but that they muſt ſee, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Second Declaration that his Majeſty made in that very Seſſion concerning the Succeſſion: and the Houſe of Lords refuſing to joyn with them in the firſt of theſe Votes that introduced that Bill, that they ſhould never be able to get it paſs into an <hi>Act,</hi> but then they might eaſily foreſee however it would be a powerful means of inciting the People againſt all that ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, and prevail with them to paſs a Sentence upon them as Popiſhly affected at leaſt, if not down-right Arrant Papiſts; and herein they had great part of their deſign, and there was no Motive more frequently uſed than this, and for the moſt part it was driven a little higher and urged againſt his Majeſty too, as by the bye, thus, <hi>What, will you give your Voice for—who is a Papiſt, and Voted for the Duke of</hi> York <hi>in the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, who is an Arrant Papiſt, and the King is little better.</hi> Which words were actually ſpoken by one of that Party, and Sworn upon him at his Majeſty's Suit, and for which the party was Fined Five hundred Marks in the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> And by this Sole Argument they prevailed to Exclude almoſt all thoſe Gentlemen, and to fill up their places with men of their own principles, and traduced his Majeſty, the Court, and all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of State, and almoſt all the Gentry and Loyal Clergy too for endeavouring to have theſe men choſen again.</p>
                     <p>The Second Thing that they made great advantage of, was the pretended diſcovery of Sir <hi>S. Fox</hi> of the Penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Long Loyal Parliament; which diſcovery being
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56751:75"/>haſtily made, and No Record of it being entred, they took the Confidence to Add to it whomſoever they were pleaſed to have ſo thought, by the ſmall Free-men and Free-holders, and that was a Number it may be double and treble to that Sir <hi>S.</hi> mentioned; however I am ſure that the Written Liſts that were then ſpread abroad, and which were all of Equal Authority, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſo, did not agree, ſome having more Names than other, and I am well aſſured that ſome Perſons Named were not Penſioners, nor could be ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe Sir <hi>S.</hi> never ſaid they were; but they were added by the Tranſcribers, according to their private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts or Paſſions, but they made the People believe they knew who would be Penſioners too, which was ſomewhat difficult, and led the diffidence to that height, as to Exclude, as far as they could poſſibly, not onely all the Courtiers and other Perſons who had any Places of Profit and Advantage under his Majeſty, but their Relations too; and Wanted not much that they had Excluded all thoſe who bore any honorary Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Offices, ſuch as Deputy-Lieutenants and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace. So that nothing now recommended a man ſo effectually for a Parliament-man, as that he had not been thought fit to be truſted in the leaſt by his Majeſty or their Neighbour Gentry; or having been ſo, had been turned out: all which were applauded as Men not to be bought, Enemies to the Court, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and therefore true Friends to the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the Country. All which tended (as they ſaid) to the Advancement of his Majeſties Service, and to the increaſing the Love of the People towards him and the Government, and he was a hard-hearted man who called the Sincerity of their Loyal intentions in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56751:76"/>
                     <p>Theſe two being added to all the Ill ways they had made uſe of in the former Election, no wonder if his Majeſty was not Satisfied with the Returns, when he faw by them what men he was to meet in his next Houſe of Commons. Whereupon his Majeſty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued them at the day of their meeting till a further time, and ſo kept them from meeting to Sit till the <hi>21th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1680. And now let us ſee how they behaved themſelves in this Interval. Wherein I ſhall deſire the Reader's Excuſe if I do not relate things in that preciſe order they fell out, it being nothing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to my purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſties Intentions of Proroguing the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from time to time, ſo as not to permit a Seſsion till the time he had deſigned, which was a Year, being once known, the great Contrivers of all our Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who met, and ordered all things in Clubbs and cloſe Cabals, fell into the greateſt Paſſion imaginable, they had carried things to that height, out of deſign to force the King to Diſſolve that Parliament, or yield more than he could either ſpare or recall; but then they had made their count he could not continue long without another Parliament, and the quick choyce, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Men generally Returned was,<note place="margin">Appeal from the Country to the City.</note> as they gave out in their Pamphlets, according to their hearts deſire: But then if they might be diſſolved or prorogued when ever they came to Redreſs the Grievances of the People, that is, when ever his Majeſty pleaſed to think it Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and eſpecially for ſo long a time, the heat the People were then in might cool, other thoughts might ariſe, the fears of an immediate Execution of the Plot upon them, might appear (as they knew they were) vain and ſalſe. His Majeſty might Recover his Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his People, and ſhew he was able to Subſiſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56751:76"/>without preſent Supplies from a Parliament; and which grieved them moſt of all, he might in this time Root up the Reliques of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebellion in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that no aſſiſtance would afterwards be to be had from thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Brethren, what need ſoever they might have of them; which is as good as confeſt by the Author of the Appeal to the City.</p>
                     <p>To prevent theſe and ſeveral other dreadful Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Nature, they caſt their heads what courſe they ſhould take, the way of Pamphlets was ſlow and uncertain, and they had almoſt Cloyed the Appetite of the Nation with that Crude ſort of Rebellious and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Diſcourſes, which ſerved rather for the divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Idle men, then gave them any great Advantage, at leaſt for the preſent; and they had need, in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, of ſome very quick and powerful Expedient, that might work upward upon the King, and downward upon the People.</p>
                     <p>Neither could they then bethink themſelves of any better remedy than to revive the old way of Tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Petitions, ſigned by all ſorts of people, and that in vaſt Numbers. The firſt of which ſort, as I believe,<note place="margin">An. <hi>1603.</hi> C. Hiſ. <hi>Book 9.</hi> Pag. <hi>7.</hi>

And as to the <hi>Kentiſh-men,</hi> who by their Grand Jury about the ſame time had framed a Petition for Peace in the Name of the whole Shire, they by the <hi>Committee</hi> for that County prohibited the ſame, by a Printed Paper publiſhed in all the Churches, Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be SEDITIOUS and TUMULTUOUS, and ſaying, that <hi>They would hang up two in every Pariſh, that were promoters of it, and Sequeſter the reſt.</hi> Which was to declare themſelves <hi>Abhorrers</hi> with a <hi>Vengeance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet this Unruly Engine was the only tool our Sober Proteſtants could at this time think powerful enough to Compel his Majeſty to recede from his declared Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and permit the Parliament to Sit forthwith; and the method they uſed was preciſely the ſame that had been imployed againſt his Majeſty's Father of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, <hi>viz.</hi> theſe Petitions were drawn by their Clubbs and Cabals in <hi>London:</hi> or ſome ſay onely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed from an Old 41. Copy, and then ſent down by truſty men who had five ſhillings <hi>per Centum,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing hands, and<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions were,</hi> That it mattered not tho they were neither Gentlemen nor Free-holders, but that they <hi>(the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Subſcriptions)</hi> ſhould get as many Hands as they could.</note> that of all Sorts and Ages, Degrees and Qualities; not caring who they were, ſo the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was great: And I have been told this Story from
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56751:78"/>Credible hands, One of theſe Procurers coming to a Godly Weaver in <hi>Eſſex</hi> to get his hand to the Petition, bethought himſelf that the Weaver had a Boy to his Son, and asked if he would not Subſcribe too? <hi>Yes,</hi> replyed the Weaver, <hi>if he were at home, but he is now gone with a Cow to a Neighbour's Bull. That is nothing,</hi> ſaid the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-Monger, <hi>I can ſet his hand.</hi> Which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly preſently did, and made the poor Boy become an humble Supplicant to the King, when he thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs. But I muſt confeſs they varied in one thing from the Old method; for they did not preſent them as heretofore by the hands of great Multitudes of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, but ſent them by ſome few perſons of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort, which was a Civility was not ſo much paid to his Majeſty, as his Guards, who might have endangered theſe Gentlemen Orators Skulls, if they had made as bold with the Son, as their Predeceſſors did with the Unarmed Father.</p>
                     <p>For my part, when I reflect ſeriouſly on this Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, I cannot perſwade my ſelf they had any great hope to prevail upon the King by it; who too well remembred what ill Conſequences had followed this way of proceeding in the Reign of his Father, to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it in his own, by granting any thing that was ſo asked. And therefore I conceive the Cunningeſt of them had theſe further ends in it: Firſt, to Engage men by theſe Subſcriptions to be more faſt to them, and their deſigns. Secondly, To Try whether the People might be brought to Tumult if they had occaſion for it. Thirdly, To incenſe them the more againſt the Government if theſe Petitions were denyed, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it as a perſonal injury to them, every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Naturally more fond of his own than anothers Counſel. Fourthly, to ſhew the Number and Strength
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56751:78"/>of their Adherents. Fifthly, To make them known each to other, to which end the Odd Phraſes, Whining Tones, Devout ſhruggs of old, and the Green Ribbans of late, were taken up alſo.</p>
                     <p>But whatever the deſign was, his Majeſty having the Authority of a <hi>Statute</hi> on his ſide wiſely provided in better times, had the Addreſs to diſappoint this Project;<note place="margin">13 Cor. 2. c. 5. as alſo by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Judges, 2 <hi>Jacobi.</hi>

Secondly, by diſcountenancing and ſharply reprehending thoſe that were ſo ſilly as to preſent them. Thirdly, by encouraging another Sort of perſons who upon better grounds were as ready to deteſt and abhor them in a more Regular and Legal way; and theſe being for the moſt part men of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their Country, ſo quelled this many-headed <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> that the triple Cordial of a Commons Vote have not been able ſince to Revive it: And ſo I ſhall take my leave of it, till I come to thoſe Votes and the proceedings upon them.</p>
                     <p>In the Interim, I deſire my dear Countrymen, they would reflect Seriouſly upon what is here ſaid, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what fruits they reaped of this pernicious ſeed the laſt time they were prompted by this Sort of men to the uſe of it, and how they Treated the <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> men for uſing it to a purpoſe for which it was never deſigned, the procuring PEACE.</p>
                     <p>His Majeſty therefore Prorogued the Parliament from the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to the 26 of <hi>January,</hi> and then meeting them in Perſon and making a Gracious Speech to them, Prorogued them to the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and then to the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and from thence to the Firſt of <hi>July,</hi> and ſo on to the <hi>22d.</hi> of the ſame, and thence to the <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and from thence to the 21. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>

                     <p>The firſt I will Inſtance in was their Treatment of the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices. Some of them had been buſy in Burning the Pope, and after that had been drawn in to Sign the Petition; but finding they had diſobliged others by it,<note place="margin">

                     <p>In the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> his Majeſty had two or three Fits of an Ague, which went off again without any great hazard to his Life; yet this occaſioned ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Events.

                           <p>In <hi>April</hi> Laſt We found the ſame Rumour not only <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived</hi> again, but alſo <hi>Improved</hi> with New Additions, to wit, It was given out, That there was a <hi>Writing</hi> yet <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> and lately produced before ſeveral Perſons, whereby the ſaid <hi>Marriage</hi> or <hi>Contract</hi> at leaſt, (for the Report was Various) would appear, and that there are ſeveral Lords and others yet Living, who were pretended to have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the ſaid Marriage. We Knew full well that it was Impoſſible that any thing of this ſhould be true, (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nothing more Groundleſs and Falſe then that there was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56751:81"/>any ſuch Marriage or Contract between <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and he ſaid Mrs. <hi>Walters</hi> alias <hi>Barlow</hi>) Yet We proceeded to call be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and cauſed to be Interrogated in the Council ſuch Lords and other perſons as the Common Rumour did Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to have been preſent at the pretended Marriage, or to Know ſomething of it, or of the ſaid Writing. And Though it appeared to all Our Council upon the Hearing of the ſaid Lords and other perſons ſeverally Interrogated, and upon their denying to have been preſent at any ſuch Marriage, or to Know any thing of it or of any ſuch Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, That the Raiſing and Spreading of ſuch a Report ſo incoherent in the ſeveral parts of it, was the Effect of deep Malice in ſome few, and of Looſe and Idle diſcourſe in others, Yet, We think it Requiſite at this time, to make Our <hi>Declarations</hi> above recited more Publick; and to <hi>Order</hi> the Same (as We do hereby with the Advice of Our <hi>Privy Council</hi>) to be forthwith Printed and Publiſhed. And We do again upon this Occaſion call Almighty God to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Declare upon the Faith of a Chriſtian, and the Word of a King, That there was never any Marriage, or Contract of Marriage had or made between <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Walters</hi> alias <hi>Barlow,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Monmouth's</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or between <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and any Woman whatſoever, Our Royal Confort Queen <hi>Catherine,</hi> that now is, Excepted.</p>
                           <p>And We do hereby Strictly Require and Command all Our Subjects whatſoever, That they preſume not to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tter or Publiſh any thing contrary to the Tenor of this Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, at their Peril, and upon pain of being proceeded againſt according to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmoſt Severity and Rigour of the Law.</p>

                     <p>On the <hi>15th</hi> of the ſame Month of <hi>June,</hi> Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General by his Majeſties Command, moved in the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> That theſe <hi>Declarations</hi> might be Enrolled and made a Record of that Court, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of them; and in order thereunto, the Rords, and others of his Majeſties Privy Council, who were preſent when his Majeſty made and Signed thoſe <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> (and were Now in Court) being deſired to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the ſame: They did it upon their <hi>Oaths;</hi> as did likewiſe the Clerks of the Council; and then it was <hi>Ordered,</hi> That the ſaid Declarations ſhould be enrolled accordingly.</p>
                     <p>And when about this time his Majeſty had ſent the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to reſide for ſome time beyond the Seas, that he might not be made a Stale to theſe Mens ill deſigns, they wrought ſo much upon him, that he returned without his Majeſties Leave, and all his Places which were of great Value as well as Truſt, Power, and Honour, were taken from him.</p>
                     <p>In the Laſt Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> day of <hi>January,</hi> 1680. The <hi>Commons</hi> paſt theſe Votes.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved, That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, That <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> hath been Removed from his Offices and Commands, by the Influence of the Duke of <hi>York.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ordered, That an humble Application be made to His Majeſty from this Houſe, by ſuch Members thereof, as are of his Majeſties Moſt Honourable Privy Council, to deſire his Majesty to Reſtore the ſaid <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to his ſaid Offices and Commands.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Now let it be Conſidered, That there was not the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56751:82"/>leaſt regard had to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> or his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, till this day, in all that Seſſion of Parliament; and now when it was ſaid they ſhould be Prorogued, and all the reaſon in the world to believe that a Diſſolution would follow, the laſt day in probability they were to Sit, his Majeſty being alſo diſoblig'd by the <hi>Votes</hi> about the Revenue; ſo that it could not be Expected that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any thing could be granted; and when they could not Hope to ſee any effect of it, they paſſed theſe two Votes. For what might be expected from it, let his Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and all the World Judge.</p>
                     <p>I have heard ſome men inſinuate, that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was ſent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> (tho there was no need of him) that by that Defeat of the Diſſenters, he might be rendered odious to their Partiſans here in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo be turned out of all his Places, and No man Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf for him; he having, as they would inſinuate, no Friends in <hi>England</hi> but they.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, That it ought to be Conſidered, that on the one Side his Majeſty, who is the Father of the Duke, appears, whom all the World (his worſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies not Excepted) acknowledg to be a Prince of a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Goodneſs and Clemency to his very Enemies; and on the other Side a Company of Men who have given large Demonſtrations that they are Enemies to Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy it ſelf; and therefore not likely to be over-kind to any of the Royal Family, but for ill Ends, and ſuch as the Duke hath no reaſon to promote, if he did perfectly Underſtand them.</p>
                     <p>Now let any man reflect upon this, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce as his Reaſon ſhall direct him, whether his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or the Anti-Court Party were likelieſt to deſign
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56751:83"/>the Ruine of the Duke; that is, A Kind Father, or an Enraged and diſobliged Enemy: To ſay here, as they commonly do, That his Majeſty was impoſed upon by Crafty men, contrary to his Natural Goodneſs, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Ruine of his Son, is to Exalt his Goodneſs to the deſtruction of his Prudence, and repreſent him to the World as meerly paſſive, a Perſon eaſie to be deluded and abuſed; the contrary of which is moſt apparent by his Actions, tho it ſhould be granted, that (as a Man) he hath ſome few times been deceived.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Various Tricks and Projects that were then Set a foot, or Continued, there was none that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo well, as a Cuſtom which was taken up ſince the Expiring of the Acts for the Regulating of Printing, <hi>viz.</hi> to Print Weekly Intelligences or News-Books.

                           <p>WHEREAS it is of great Importance to the State, that all News Printed and Publiſhed to the People, as well concerning Foreign as Domeſtick Affairs, ſhould be agreeable to Truth, or at least Warranted by Good Intelligence, that the Minds of his Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may not be diſturbed or amuzed by Lies or vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which are many times raiſed on purpoſe to Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the <hi>Government,</hi> or for other indirect Ends: And whereas of Late many Evil-diſpoſed Perſons have made it a Common practiſe to Print and Publiſh Pamphlets of News, without Licence or Authority, and therein have vended to his Majeſties People, all the Idle and Malicious Reports that they could Collect or Invent, contrary to Law; the Continuance whereof would in a ſhort time endanger the Peace of the Kingdom, the ſame manifeſtly tending

                     <p>There was ſcarce any thing more Clamoured againſt than the Proceedings upon this Proclamation, as if all the Liberties of the Subject in <hi>England</hi> had Conſiſted in this, that they might be deluded and abuſed, terrified and affrighted, flattered and enticed, by whoſoever had the Impudence to Undertake it, and that Weekly.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Sorts of News-Mongers in the Interim are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing but a ſort of State Tale-bearers: Now to make the Miſchief more Apparent, to any man that is fond of this Sort of Traſh, let them but conſider what would follow in a private Family, if the Maſter of it ſhould permit this Sort of Vermin to Act at Liberty what Feuds, Heart-burnings, Fears, Diſtruſts and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Hatreds would ariſe; ſo that no man could be able to maintain the Peace of his own houſe, if he might not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56751:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>puniſh nor turn out ſuch perſons. Now the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, onely much worſe, muſt needs follow in a City, Country, or Kingdom; for in a private Family the truth of things may be eaſily found out, the Parties being together; and yet 'tis a mighty trouble to peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people to be always contending and proving againſt others: but in the other inſtance it is impoſſible often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for an innocent perſon to repreſent his Innocency, or diſprove his Accuſer. Now if it be true of the meaneſt private perſon, That A Good Name is to be valued as a man's Life, how much more reaſonable is it that the Eſtimation of Princes, and Great Men ſhould not ly at the Mercy of a company of Mean Scriblers? It is uſually ſaid, <hi>Malice ſpeaks well of no body;</hi> but to be ſure if that be tainted with ambition and faction, the very poyſon of Aſps will be ſhot out upon the Governors that oppoſe and hinder their wicked Intentions and Deſigns.</p>
                     <p>Nor is all this a Speculation, but an Experimented Truth, the ſame Sort of Men by the ſame ways, in the Memory of Vaſt Numbers of Men, once before Ruined this Kingdom, and brought his Majeſty's Father to the Block; as He Himſelf hath Elegantly deſcribed it in his <hi>Eikon Baſilike, Cap.</hi> 15.

                           <p>IF I had not my own Innocency, and Gods Protection, it were hard for Me to ſtand out againſt theſe Stratagems and Conflicts of Malice, which by Falſities ſeek to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Truth, and by <hi>Jealouſies</hi> to ſupply the defect of Real <hi>Cauſes,</hi> which might ſeem to Justifie ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements against Me.</p>

For thoſe, who were impatient any mens Counſels but their own ſhould be followed in Church or State; who were So Eager in giving Me better Counſel, that they would not give me Leave to take it with Freedom, as a Man; or Honour, as a King; making their Counſels more like a Drench that must be poured down, than a Draught which might be fairly and leiſurely drank, if I liked it.</p>
                           <p>I will not Juſtifie beyond humane Errours and Frailties my Self, or my Counſellours: They might be ſubject to ſome miſcarriages, yet ſuch as were far more Reparable by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and better thoughts than thoſe enormious Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, wherewith ſome men have Now even wildred, and almoſt quite Loſt both Church and State.</p>
                           <p>The Event of things at last will make it evident to my Subjects, That had I followed the worst Counſels, that my worſt Counſellors ever had the boldneſs to offer to Me, or my Self any Inclination to uſe; I could not ſo ſoon have brought both Church and State in Three Flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to ſuch a <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſions and Hell of Miſeries, as ſome have done; out of which they cannot or will not in

                           <p>I cannot ſuffer ſo much in Point of Honour, by thoſe Rude and Scandalous <hi>PAMPHLETS,</hi> (which like fire in great Conflagrations, flie up and down to ſet all places on like flames) as thoſe men do; who pretending ſo much to Piety, are ſo forgetful of their Duty to God and Me: by no ways ever Vindicating the Majeſty of their King againſt any of thoſe who contrary to the Precept of God, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent of Angels, ſpeak evil of Dignities, and bring Rayling Accuſations againſt thoſe, who are honoured with the Name of Gods: but 'tis no wonder if Men not fearing God, ſhould not honour their King.</p>

No ſurely, it can never be expected; and were not another Rebellion deſigned, it would never be deſired: Thus the Laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and thus the Next muſt begin.

                           <p>THE ſeveral Prorogations I have made, have been very advantagious to Our Neighbours, and Very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Me; for I have imployed that time in making and perfecting an Alliance with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that which I had before with the <hi>States of the United Provinces,</hi> and they alſo had with <hi>Spain,</hi> Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mutual Obligations of Succour and Defence.</p>
                           <p>I have all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that what was ſo much deſired by former Parliaments, muſt needs be very grateful to you now: for tho ſome perhaps may wiſh theſe Meaſures had been taken ſooner, yet no man can with reaſon think it is now too Late; for they who deſire to make theſe Alliances, and they who deſire to break them, ſhew themſelves of another Opinion.</p>
                           <p>And as theſe are the best Meaſures that could be taken for the Safety of <hi>England</hi> and Repoſe of Chriſtendom, So they cannot fail to attain their End, and to ſpread and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves further, if Our Diviſions at home do not render Our Friendſhip leſs Conſiderable abroad.</p>
                           <p>To prevent theſe as much as may be, I think fit to renew to you all the Aſſurances which can be deſired, That nothing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56751:87"/>ſhall be wanting on My part to give you the fulleſt Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction your Hearts can wiſh, for the Security of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, which I am fully reſolved to maintain againſt all the Conſpiracies of Our Enemies, and to Concur with You in any new Remedies which ſhall be propoſed, that may Conſiſt with the preſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its Due and Legal Courſe of Deſcent.</p>
                           <p>And in Order to this, I do recommend to You, to purſue the further Examination of the <hi>Plot,</hi> with a ſtrict and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Enquiry. I do not think My Self Safe nor You nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till that Matter be gone thro with; and therefore it will be neceſſary that the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> be brought to their ſpeedy Tryal that Juſtice may be done.</p>
                           <p>I need not tell you what danger the City of <hi>Tangier</hi> is in, nor of what Importance it is to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s to preſerve it. I have with a mighty Charge and Expence ſent a very Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Relief thither; but Conſtantly to maintain ſo great a Force as that War will require, and to make thoſe New Works and Fortifications, without which the Place will not be long Teneable, amounts to ſo Vaſt a Sum, that without Your Support it will be impoſſible for me to undergo it. Therefore I lay the matter plainly before You, and deſire Your Advice and Aſsiſtance.</p>
                           <p>But that which I Value above all the Treaſure in the World, and which I am Sure will give Me greater Strength and Reputation both at home and abroad then any Treaſure can do, is a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NION amongst Our Selves.</p>
                           <p>Nothing but this can reſtore the Kingdom to that Strength and Vigor which it ſeems to have Loſt, and raiſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s again to that Conſideration which <hi>England</hi> hath <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſually had.</p>
                           <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> have their Eyes upon this Aſſembly, and think their own Happineſs or Miſery as well as Ours will depend upon it.</p>

                           <p>Let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s therefore take Care that We do not Gratifie Our Enemies, and Diſhearten Our Friends by any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſeaſonable Diſputes.</p>

                           <p>WE Your Majeſties moſt Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, the Commons in Parliament Aſſembled, being highly Zealous for the preſervation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, Your Majeſties Sacred Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and reſolving to purſue with a ſtrict and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Inquiry the Execrable Popiſh Plot which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in the Two Laſt Parliaments, and has been Supported and Carried on by potent and reſtleſs Practiſes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, eſpecially during the late Receſſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby ſeveral perſons have been terrified and diſcouraged from declaring their Knowledg thereof; moſt humbly beſeech Your Majeſty, That for the Security of ſuch perſons who ſhall be willing to give Evidence, or make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satisfactory Diſcovery concerning the ſame to this Houſe, Your Majeſty would be pleaſed to Iſſue Your Royal Proclamation, aſſuring all the ſaid perſons, of your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

                     </floatingText>
                     <p>There was two Exceptions taken to this Addreſs by others, Tho I find none made in the Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt was, That in the height of their Zeal they forgot to tell his Majeſty what Proteſtant Religion they meant or deſired to preſerve, for there being in <hi>England</hi> many not onely ſeveral but contrary Religions, which yet may be Comprehended under that General term of <hi>Protestant.</hi> Some of which are worſe than Popery, they were not to be preſerved but Suppreſſed, if it might be; Except they intended in oppoſition to Popery to uphold all the Hereſies and Schiſmes that aroſe in the late Rebellion amounting to near Eightſcore, as they have been counted; but then it had been better to have called them <hi>Proteſtant Religions:</hi> for it is a perfect piece of Nonſence to call theſe Contrary and Contending Factions, who do mutually endeavour to Ruine each other, tho they are now Combined as much againſt the Religion that is Eſtabliſhed, as againſt Popery, and to Act againſt it with more fury than they do againſt Popery; I ſay it is Nonſence to call theſe Conjoyntly Religion, when if there be or ever were any ſuch things as different Religions in the World, theſe are ſuch, and they are as Contrary to the Religion eſtabliſhed, and each to other as they are to Popery.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the Parliaments had always qualified that looſe general word, with ſuch terms as theſe, <hi>Eſtabliſhed,</hi> or by <hi>Law Eſtabliſhed,</hi> or the like; and ſometimes not ſo much as mentioned the Word <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry improperly affixed to any Party of the Reformed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56751:91"/>Religions of <hi>England,</hi> there being perhaps never a <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to take it ſtrictly.</p>
                     <p>But we ſhall ſee afterwards that it was not a Caſual or Accidental omiſſion here, but as theſe Proteſtants at Large had advanced the greater part of theſe Commons into that high dignity, ſo they were reſolved, to lift them up above the Church and Laws by way of Reward, tho the Peace of the Nation and the Government were Ruined by it.</p>
                     <p>The Second thing objected was, That they Tacitly and Injuriouſly reflected upon His Majeſty in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, That during the Receſs of Parliament, ſeveral perſons had been terrified and diſcouraged from declaring their Knowledg of the Plot. As for the <hi>Receſſes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations</hi> and <hi>Diſſolutions</hi> of the Parliaments, they were apparently forced upon the King much againſt his Will by the unreaſonable Heats, Feuds, and Irregularities of the Commons, and ſo the King was not to be blamed; and all that would Inform any thing concerning the <hi>Plott</hi> in theſe Intervals had been as Kindly uſed by the King and Councel, as they could have been by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. So that this was, as I ſaid, an Injurious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon His Majeſty and the Government, and was an Argument of an ill temper, and could not but diſguſt his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Their limiting their Petition of Pardon to onely ſuch perſons as made any Diſcovery to their Houſe, was look't upon as much reſtrain'd; for if the Diſcovery were really and effectually made, what matter was it to what houſe or perſon it was made. But it may be this might not be intended by them for any ſuch purpoſe as the limiting of the thing to them, tho in effect it did ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall paſs it over.</p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:56751:91"/>
                     <p>From this <hi>Addreſs</hi> the Houſe proceeded to the <hi>Votes</hi> about the Petitions; which were as followeth.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved, Nemine Contradicente. <hi>Which ſhewes the Strength of the party, and not the Conſent of the whole Houſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That it is, and Ever hath been, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted Right of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> to Petition the King for the Calling and Sitting of Parliaments, and Redreſſing of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved, N. C.</p>
                        <p>That to traduce ſuch Petitioning <hi>(howſoever managed, for ſo it muſt ſignifie, or elſe it will conclude nothing from the Other as a Principle)</hi> as a Violation of Duty, and to repreſent it to his Majeſty as Tumultuous and Seditious, is to betray the Liberty of the Subject, and Contributes to the Deſign of Subverting the Antient Legal Conſtitutions of this Kingdom, and introducing <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ordered,</p>
                        <p>That a Committee be appointed to inquire of all ſuch perſons as have offended againſt theſe Rights of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved,</p>
                        <p>That an Addreſs be made to his Majeſty, declaring the Reſolution of this Houſe to Preſerve and Support the King's Perſon and Government, and the Proteſtant Religion at home and abroad.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This laſt ſeemed to ſweeten the Crudity of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Votes,</hi> and to Countenance and Juſtifie one of the greateſt diſorders that Contributed to the Ruine of his Father.</p>
                     <p>As to their firſt <hi>Vote,</hi> which is their Principle, it is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56751:92"/>granted <hi>modo &amp; forma</hi> as they have ſet it down.</p>
                     <p>But the Second is too general, and an Undeniable foundation for Rebellion, as hath been Experimented: for all the Controverſie was here about the manner of Petitioning, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a few private men might agree upon a Petition, and then ſend Emiſſaries abroad to procure Hundreds and Thouſands of Ignorant people to Subſcribe it, and then tender it to his Majeſty, as it were by the Number to fright him into a Complyance with them againſt his declared Reſolution to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: if this might be allowed, the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would ſoon eat up the Prerogative of the King, and diſorder this or any other Government in the World.</p>
                     <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, one <hi>Thomas Flammock,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lord Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con<hi>'s</hi> Hiſt. of H. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> a Lawyer, thought he could make a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and never break the Peace; and the People of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall</hi> being diſcontented about ſome Subſidies granted to the King, he perſwades them that it was not good they ſhould ſtand like Sheep before the Shearers, but put on Harneſs and take <hi>Weapons</hi> in their hands: yet to do no Creature hurt, but go and deliver the King a <hi>Strong Petition,</hi> for the Laying down of thoſe grievous <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and for the Puniſhment of thoſe that had given him that Counſel, and to make others beware how they did the like in time to come: And he ſaid for his part, <hi>He did not ſee how they could do the Duty of true Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and good Liege-men, except they did deliver the King from ſuch Wicked ones, that would deſtroy both him and the Country;</hi> or in the Language of our dayes, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Arbitrary Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And accordingly 16000 men armed, aſſembled, and marched from <hi>Cornwal</hi> to <hi>Black-Heath</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> Modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Quietly enough, Except that at <hi>Taunton</hi> in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſetſhire</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:56751:92"/>they killed, in fury, an Officious and Eager Commiſſioner for the Subſidy, whom they called the Provoſt of <hi>Perin:</hi> but by that time they came at <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> they Threatned either to bid Battle to the King (for now the Seas went higher than his Councellors) or to take <hi>London</hi> within his View; imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there to find no leſs fear than wealth. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they perſiſted, till the King having drawn out his Forces and Surrounded them, he fought them, and killed 20000, and took all the reſt Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>Now I would Know whether this <hi>Strong Petition</hi> was Juſtifiable, and whether if any body in our dayes ſhould perſwade a Number of Men to Act this over again, it would be an offence againſt the Rights of the Subjects, to abhor ſuch Petitioning as a Violation of Duty, and repreſent it to his Majeſty as Tumultuous and Seditious, or rather plainly Rebellious; and it would be worth the while to try whether <hi>Flammock</hi>'s <hi>Strong Petition</hi> may not be Juſtified by theſe <hi>Votes,</hi> as they now ſtand pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for it doth not appear that any ſort of Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatſoever, may be oppoſed by the <hi>Votes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may be replyed, That here were no men in Arms in the caſe of the Petition in hand; but what then, if there ſhould be for the future, theſe <hi>Votes</hi> will Juſtify them too; for if the People may Petition for the Calling or Sitting of a Parliament, or Redreſſing of Grievances, when and howſoever they pleaſe, and no man may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, then is Honeſt Old Father <hi>Flammock</hi>'s <hi>Strong Petition,</hi> which was for the Redreſs of two Notable Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, fairly Juſtifiable, if it were now to be acted over again: But if the People be allowed to Petition, but not any way, it had been fit to have told us, and them, what
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56751:93"/>manner of way they were allowed to Petition, as well as for what; for that was the main thing in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing they were not ſo kind to the People, I will try if I cannot direct them into a better courſe the next time they ſhall have an Occaſion to Petition the King for the <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Sitting</hi> of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſsing of Grievances.</hi> And to that purpoſe I will here inſert a whole <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>

                     <p>Now had this Act of Parliament been purſued, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there would have been no Controverſie in this caſe; and there was great reaſon it ſhould,<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe.</note> By reaſon of the Unquietneſs of the Times, when every thing ſeemed to tend to the renewing of thoſe Calamities the Act mentions in the <hi>Preface,</hi> and was made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing it had been never ſo Regular, what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56751:94"/>reaſon can be aſſigned why one part of the People ſhould be freer to Petition for any thing, than the other was againſt it, if one party may for the inſtance Petition the King to change his Mind after he hath declared it in any cauſe, why is not the other part as free to deſire him not to change? now that which may ſeem a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Grievance</hi> to one County or Place, may be a great Advantage to another, and they are totally debarred of all means of Maintaining their preſent advantage, if they may not Counter-Petition.</p>
                     <p>But in this caſe here the perſons that Petitioned were private men, and contrary to the expreſs Letter of this Act, ſolicited hands in an irregular way; and ſuch ſort of hands, as beſides their Number, were of No Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for the directions that they ſent with the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were, That it mattered not whether they were Gentlemen, or ſo much as Free-holders, ſo they were Numerous. Now let any man conſider whether it be reaſonable that a company of Rude Country Clowns, and a parcel of Pragmatical Apron-men, ſhould contrary to his Majeſty's Proclamation pretend themſelves wiſe enough to Adviſe his Majeſty when the Parliament ſhould Sit. But if it be alledged, That there were others beſides theſe: why were not theſe totally left out? why was there ſuch care that the Subſcriptions ſhould be ſo Numerous? did theſe ſmall Folk add any weight to the Adviſe? No ſurely.</p>
                     <p>On the other Hand, they that appeared againſt them were Parliament-men themſelves, Juſtices of the Peace, Grand Juries at Aſſizes and Seſſions, Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Magiſtrates in Corporations, men full as likely to Underſtand what was fit to be done, and as Unlikely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56751:95"/>to betray the true Liberties of the People on the one hand, or to invade the juſt Prerogatives of the Crown on the other; but then theſe were men true to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government by Law eſtabliſhed; and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners were of the ſame ſort, for the moſt part, with them that had brought on the former Calamities by this and other ſuch ſpecious and popular pretences, to the ruine both of King and People, Prerogative and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and therefore the more juſtly ſuſpected to be play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Old Game.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may ſuffice concerning the <hi>Votes;</hi> And now let us ſee how they proceeded againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Offenders. And in the firſt place Sir <hi>Francis Withens,</hi> a Member of their Houſe, being accuſed on this Account as an offender againſt the Rights of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who was not then preſent, It was</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ordered,</hi>

                     <p>That Notice ſhould be given him to attend in his place the next Morning.</p>

                  <div n="44-83" type="pages">
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday October</hi> 28.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>F.

                     </p>
                     <p>Then they fell upon an Information which had been given the Houſe againſt Sir <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Cann,</hi> a Member of the Houſe, That they did in <hi>October</hi> 1679, Publickly declare, <hi>That there was no Popiſh Plot, but a Presbyterian Plot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which was atteſted againſt them by Mr. <hi>Row,</hi> Sword-Bearer of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> a Member of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56751:95"/>Houſe. Sir <hi>Robert Cann</hi> being to make his defence, Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſeveral Reproachful and Reflecting words againſt Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> for which he was called to the Bar, and received a Reprehenſion on his Knees, and then being ordered to withdraw, they Voted he ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the<note n="*" place="margin">Where he lay till the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Novemb.</hi> &amp; then was diſcharged.</note>

                     <p>This weighty affair took up the whole day, and it had been well ſpent, if the Popiſh Plot had been made one jot the plainer, or the Presbyterian Plot ever ſo little taken off by it; but the World was full as well ſatified of the truth of the former before, notwithſtanding what theſe Gentlemen had ſaid to the Contrary; and much confirmed in the truth of the latter, by this Violent, if not Arbitrary way of proceeding againſt them.</p>
                     <p>For if theſe Gentlemen had offended againſt any Law, why were they not proſecuted in a Legal way, where they might have made a Legal defence, and have received a Legal Sentence? But here they had nothing but bare affirmations, without any witneſs to defend them; and a Sentence founded upon this as ſharp, chargeable, and diſhonourable as was poſſible.

                     <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> A Bill for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the Elections of Members to Serve in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Houſe of Commons, was read the firſt time, and ordered to be read the ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>And the ſame day the Bill for prohibiting the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel was read the third time and paſſed, and ſent up to the Lords.</p>
                     <p>Now let the Reader obſerve, there was not one Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Bill paſſed through the Houſe of Commons in all this time, but this; and yet no Bill was more oppoſed than this: but here the priyate Concerns of the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> Country Gentlemen were Engaged, and therefore they carried it on Might and Main againſt all oppoſition; but as for any Bills againſt Popery, they took no care or thought: for that againſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> may perhaps be made to appear to be of another Nature then was pretended, and rather againſt any thing then Popery.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Lords ſent down to the Commons a Bill which they had paſſed, for Freeing the City of <hi>London,</hi> and his Majeſty's Court and the Parts adjacent, from Popiſh Inhabitants, and providing againſt other Dangers which may ariſe from Papiſts. To which they deſired their Concurrence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That this Bill had been ſent down from the Lords before, and the Commons had loſt the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of paſſing it, as you will ſee they will in this Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56751:101"/>alſo, tho there were Tragical repreſentations made of the Danger the City and Nation were in from the Vaſt Numbers of them which were Seated in and about the City of <hi>London:</hi> The truth is, it was not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to looſe any thing that might ſerve to fright the People, and much better to have Papiſts in <hi>London</hi> for that purpoſe, than to have them ſent elſewhere, and looſe the means of Fermenting the Rabble. But if men were not as willing to be or at leaſt ſeem to be cheated, as others are to delude them, they would ſoon perceive whoſe intereſt it is to keep them in Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and after diſcharge their Bug-bears, or turn their rage another way.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day they Voted an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to his Majeſty, in anſwer to his laſt Meſſage.</p>
                     <p>And that they would proceed in the proſecution of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> beginning with <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1680.</p>
                     <p>A Bill to prevent the offences of <hi>Bribery,</hi> and <hi>Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,</hi> in Elections of Members to Serve in the Commons Houſe of Parliament, was Read the firſt time, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be read again the <hi>Monday</hi> following, with the Bill for Regulating Elections of Members to Serve in the ſaid Houſe, formerly mentioned.</p>
                     <p>This day the Bill againſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was read the third time, and paſſed; The Title whereof was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be, <hi>An Act for Securing of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by Diſabling</hi> James <hi>Duke of</hi> York <hi>to Inherit the Imperial Crown of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Territories thereunto belonging.</hi> And it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſhould carry it up to the Lords, for their Concurrence.</p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56751:101"/>
                     <p>The Bill ſent down by the Lords for Freeing the City of <hi>London</hi> from Popiſh Recuſants, was read the firſt time on <hi>Friday,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>12.</hi> Nov.</note> and Ordered a ſecond reading in a full Houſe.</p>
                     <p>This day the Commons ſent a Meſſage to the Lords, to Acquaint them with their Intentions to begin with the Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> and to deſire them to appoint a Convenient time for the Tryal, and that the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> might be Confined and kept from holding Correſpondence with one another, as perſons impeached and committed for High Treaſon by Law ought to be.</p>
                     <p>The Lords anſwered, <hi>As to the latter part of this Meſſage, They had taken Care already in it; and as to the former, They appointed</hi> Tueſday <hi>the Thirtieth day of the ſame Moneth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And they further reſolved to Addreſs to his Majeſty for a Sum of Money for defraying the Charges of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning of Witneſſes and other Expences Incident to the Proſecution and Tryals of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and appointed Mr. <hi>Charles Clare</hi> to Receive and Expend the ſame; for which purpoſe his Majeſty gave Order that 100 l. ſhould be Iſſued out of the Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> being upon his own Petition called to the Bar, he Acknowledged his offence, and was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to receive the Cenſure of the Houſe upon his Knees; to which he ſubmitted, and was diſcharged, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fees.</p>
                     <p>The Lords returned the Bill againſt Importing of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel agreed to Commons the ſame day.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> having Petitioned the Houſe againſt Sir <hi>George Jeffereys</hi> their Recorder, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56751:102"/>referred to a Committee, they paſſed this Vote,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved,</p>
                        <p>That this Committee is of Opinion, That by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given to this Committee, it does appear that Sir <hi>George Jeffereys,</hi> Recorder of the City of <hi>London,</hi> by traducing and obſtructing Petitioning for the Sitting of This Parliament, hath betrayed the Rights of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>To which the Houſe agreed, and Ordered, <hi>That an Humble Addreſs be made to his Majeſty, to remove him out of all Publick Offices;</hi> and appointed a Committee to draw up the ſame. As if it had been likely his Majeſty would have ſo far complyed with them, as to have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the <hi>Recorder</hi> for obeying his Laws and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, againſt a Tumultuous and Seditious Sort of men.</p>
                     <p>But however his Majeſty might Act, they had another aim in this, for they Voted, <hi>That the Members of their Houſe that Served for the City of</hi> London, <hi>ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this Vote and Reſolution of their Houſe, to the Court of Aldermen for the City of</hi> London.</p>
                     <p>This was a ſure way to beſpeak a Party in the City to Joyn with the Houſe againſt the Abhorrers.</p>
                     <p>They further <hi>Ordered,</hi> That this Committee ſhould enquire into all ſuch perſons as have been Adviſing, or Promoting of the late Proclamation, ſtiled, <hi>A Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Tumultuous Petitioning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus having paſſed thus far without any check from any perſon, they thought they might proceed as far fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they pleaſed. And it is very probable that they were ſpurred on to this by their Friends and Enemies; the one deſigning to make them Terrible; and the other, being willing to make them Hated. However, I am ſure they they became more hated than feared by this and many other ſuch proceedings.</p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56751:102"/>
                     <p>As the Parliament, that is, the Commons, Courted the City, ſo the City was as kind to them, and Calling a Common Councel, Voted an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to his Majeſty to declare their Loyalty; and to Petition him that the <hi>Parliament</hi> might Sit until <hi>Proteſtantiſme</hi> was Secured; I believe they might mean innocently, tho I am well Secured that this would have perpetuated them to the End of the World, if ſome amongſt them might have been Judges of the time when this great work was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                     <p>But this did not Edify with his Majeſty, who pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the bottom of theſe little Projects, and was not over-pleaſed with this Correſpondency betwixt this and the Commons, remembring what ill effects this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction had in the Reign of his Father. So he Adviſed the Common-Councel to meddle with thoſe things that lay before them, and aſſuring them, <hi>That he would La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to maintain the Proteſtant Religion as it was Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law;</hi> (which was more than they deſired,) he diſmiſſed them.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> day of <hi>November.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Bill againſt the Importation of Cattel from <hi>Scotland</hi> was Read the firſt time, and Ordered a Second Reading the <hi>Saturday</hi> following at Ten of the Clock.</p>
                     <p>This day was delivered the following Meſſage to the Commons.</p>

                              <pb n="60" facs="tcp:56751:103"/>the Condition and Importance of the Place obliges his Majesty to put this Houſe in mind again, That He relies upon them for the Support of it, without which it cannot be much longer preſerved.

                     </floatingText>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Bill ſent down from the Lords, Intituled, <hi>An Act for the better Regulating the Tryals of the Peers of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>was Read the Second time, and Committed upon the Debate of the Houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This day the Bill for Diſabling the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was Read the firſt time in the Houſe of Peers; and the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being put, Whether it ſhould be read again? the Houſe divided.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Noes,</hi> 63.</item>

                     </list>
                     <p>So it was Thrown out; the Biſhops all appearing againſt the Bill, Except three, for which ſome of the Commons Reflected upon them, with great Liberty, as if no body could be for the Duke but he muſt be for Popery.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe of Commons taking notice of this, were ſo diſcompoſed, that they Adjourned themſelves on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning, and did nothing that day.</p>
                     <p>And the day following meeting in a very bad and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented humour, and taking into Conſideration the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56751:103"/>Meſſage about <hi>Tangier,</hi> They Reſolved upon an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to his Majeſty upon the Debate of the Houſe, Humbly repreſenting to him the dangerous State and Condition of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>And then it appearing that <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Hallifax</hi> had been very Active in the Houſe of Lords againſt the Bill for Diſ-inheriting the Duke, they Reſolved alſo upon another Addreſs to his Majeſty, to remove the Earl from his Majeſties Preſence and Councils for Ever. And this was all they did the Second day after. The Houſe being in a perfect Fret, and the Country-Party Heating themſelves by their Speeches to that height, they were ſcarce able to Conſider what was fit to be ſaid or asked.</p>
                     <p>And now that the Peers of <hi>England</hi> have paſſed their Judgment concerning this Bill, I will add ſome ſhort Reflections upon the Bill, which I ſhall ſhall ſubmit to my Reader, as it is fit I ſhould.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Then, I do acknowledg it is a great affliction to any <hi>Protestant</hi> Country to fall into the Hands of a Popiſh Prince; and worſe for <hi>England</hi> then for moſt other, becauſe of the great and implacable Malice the Jeſuits and the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have ever born to the Religion Eſtabliſhed amongſt us, which is more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended againſt them, then any other Reformed Church, as being founded upon greater Antiquity, and more conformable to the Primitive Church of the Three or Four firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> then either the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any of the Reformed Churches in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the World: and therefore they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Have left no ſtone unturned, to Subvert her, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their own Wit and Power againſt her ever ſince the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> began; and ſticking nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Perjury, Treaſon, Murther, nor any other Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56751:104"/>that they thought might conduce to that End: and when God had by his Gracious Providence defeated all theſe their Damnable Projects, They Transformed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the ſhapes of our own Proteſtant Diſſenters, and ſo promoted a Rebellion which ended in the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruine of this Religion and Government, to their mighty Content and Satisfaction; but tho his Majeſty at his Return re-ſettled this Church, yet they did not give over, but by a Toleration by ſpreading Pamphlets written in the Stile of the Diſſenters, and ſo very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them, by diſcouraging all that oppoſed our Inteſtine Diviſions, and a multitude of ſuch other frauds, they have in Twenty Years time ſo ſhaken her founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions again, that his Majeſty can hardly now preſerve and uphold her againſt the Popiſh Party on the one hand, and the Diſſenters on the other.</p>
                     <p>So that if this poor perſecuted Church ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of a Prince of their Communion, She is to Expect whatever the moſt Enraged Malice armed with his Authority, can inflict upon her, and She hath all the reaſon in the world to expect the Diſſenters will joyn with them to afflict and ruine her. Not out of any Kindneſs to Popery, but out of an implacable hatred they two have Conceived againſt her. So that I muſt and will Conclude the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath the greateſt reaſon in the world to dread that day that ſhall put her into ſuch hands.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſtill with this limitation notwithſtanding, that by Avoiding one Miſchief, ſhe ſhould not plunge her Self into a greater; that is, by flying a Perſecution from men, to fall into a Rebellion againſt her God and Saviour, by whoſe Providence Kings and Princes (of what Religion ſoever they be) rule; and by whom they have in all Ages been ſo Ordered, Diſpoſed and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56751:104"/>as He in his Divine and Holy Wiſdom Saw moſt Expedient for the Proſperity or Chaſtiſement of his Church, to the greater encreaſe of her Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the world to come.</p>
                     <p>Two things I will lay down as Undoubted Rules or Maximes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is an Hereditary Kingdom or Monarchy, which for many Ages hath gone to the Next Heirs, be they Males or Females, of the Blood Royal; without any Election or Conſent of the People, otherwiſe then by acknowledging their Lawful Right derived from God, by their Blood to them.</p>
                     <p>The Second is, That this Hereditary Monarchy was ſet up at firſt, and hath been ſince upheld and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Providence of God.</p>
                     <p>From which two I will infer this Concluſion, That who ever ſhall attempt to alter this Right of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion without a manifeſt revelation, (which is not now to be expected) is a Notorious Uſurper upon the Right of the Perſon who is to Succeed, be the pretence for it what it will; and a Rebel againſt that Providence which gave him that Right.</p>
                     <p>Nor will all the Antient Rebellions, Uſurpations and Diſorders, which have hapned in this Kingdom, Juſtify them that ſhall begin them again.</p>
                     <p>Now if it ſhould pleaſe God ſo to order it, that the Duke ſhould at his Majeſties Death be the Next Heir to his Crown; I cannot ſee how any humane Power ſhall prevent his Succeſſion to it, but by encroaching upon his Right, and by rebelling againſt the Divine Providence that gave it to him.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56751:105"/>
                     <p>So that be the Inconveniences that ſhall follow upon ſuch a Succeſſion what they will or can be, we muſt ſubmit to them upon pain of Rebellion againſt both God and his Anointed our Lawful Prince. And then let any man be judge whether it is better to fall into the Hands of a Popiſh Prince, or into the Hands of an Angry God, who is a Conſuming fire; and who is not bound by any Act of Parliament from afflicting a Sinful and Rebellious People.</p>
                     <p>So tho the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath all the reaſon in the world to dread ſuch a Prince, yet ſhe will have greater reaſon to dread a Rebellion againſt him, becauſe it runs her upon the Divine Vengeance, and is directly contrary to her Principles, and the Practiſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Primitive Church, and is plain down-right Popery. So that I conclude Neither She nor any of her Children, will be guilty of it, come what will come.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, we are already Sworn to <hi>Bear Faith</hi> and true Allegiance to the Kings Highneſs,<note place="margin">The Oath of Supremacy.</note> His Heirs and Lawful Succeſſors, and that to our power we ſhall aſſiſt and defend all Juriſdiction, Priviledges, Pre-Eminences and Authorities granted or belonging to the Kings Highneſs, his Heirs and Lawful Succeſſors, or United and Annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm; of which that of an hereditary Succeſſion is one of the principal; and we are Sworn not onely to his Majeſty, (whom God Long Continue) but alſo to his Lawful Succeſſors: with which Oath none but they that have that Right can diſpence; for this being a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory Oath made to them as well as him, when their Rights ſhall fall, his Majeſty cannot remit their Right, nor any of them anothers; but they have Every of them in their reſpective degrees and orders an indiſpenſable Right confirmed to them by this Oath. Nor would
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56751:105"/>they ceaſe to be Lawful Succeſſors in the Sence of this Oath, tho a Law were made to prevent, bar, or cut off their Succeſſion; becauſe all that is meant by the word <hi>Lawful,</hi> in this place, is to be underſtood by the common Rules of Succeſſion Settled by the Common Law of <hi>England; viz.</hi> the Eldeſt Son or Daughter before a Younger of the ſame Sex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if his Majeſty cannot do it, much leſs can the Lords or Commons do it, becauſe they are all within the obligation of this Oath, and it is unreaſonable that men ſhould diſpence with their own promiſſory Oathes to others; for this would deſtroy all Faith and Confidence amongſt men, and pull up the very Roots of all Society and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor can any man imagine that this Oath was made in favour of a Proteſtant Succeſſor only, <hi>H.</hi> 8. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Popiſh Prince, in whoſe time it was Settled at firſt. And the ſame in effect is Sworn by the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance with this binding Clauſe, <hi>I do believe, and in my Conſcience am reſolved, that neither the Pope, nor any other Perſon whatſoever, hath power to abſolve me of this Oath or any part thereof, which I Acknowledge by good and full Authority to be lawfully Miniſtred unto me.</hi> And by this Oath we are alſo bound to bear Faith and true Allegiance (not onely) to his Majeſty, (but to) his Heirs and Succeſſors, and Him and <hi>Them</hi> to <hi>Defend</hi> to the Utmoſt of our power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is to be underſtood according to their ſeveral and reſpective Rights, and at ſuch times as they ſhall grow and accrew to them and every of them. And altho this Oath was Introduced by a Proteſtant Prince, yet is not made to him as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but as Lawful and Rightful King of this Realm; and who ever is So, hath and muſt have Right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it upon us, be his Religion what it will. So that beſides the former Sin of Rebellion againſt the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56751:106"/>of God, Here is an Apparent and Unavoidable Perjury in this Caſe to Aggravate the other. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no good Religious man will run upon theſe two Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Sins deliberately, to avoid any temporal affliction whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>So that were the Caſe juſt ſuch as it is repreſented by the Author of the <hi>Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> It would not Juſtify the Excluding of ſuch a Succeſſor as he hath deſcribed, by Force and Arms, againſt his Right and our Oathes to the Contrary, tho we were never ſo certain to Succeed in the Attempt. But then that wicked man has moſt falſly repreſented things to us, and So as it is impoſſible they ſhould ever prove in the Event, if we do not give occaſion for it by an improſperous Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; nay I believe I may ſay if we ſhould.</p>
                     <p>Firſt it is agreed by All the World, That there are Ten Proteſtants for one Papiſt thro all the Dominions of <hi>England;</hi> So that if ſuch a Succeſſor ſhould attempt to Extirpate them; the bare refuſing to aid or aſſiſt him in ſuch an enterprize, would render it impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, All our Laws are in favour of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that is Eſtabliſhed, which could never be Repealed but in Parliament; and it is morally impoſſible to have a Parliament the major part of which will not be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who will never Conſent to ruine themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Revenue of ſuch a Prince will not bear the Charge of ſo great an Army as will be neceſſary to reduce the People to a Religion ſo generally deteſted and hated as this is.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to this, there is Two things pretended. Firſt, That he may have Foraign Ayds; And Secondly,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56751:106"/>That he will have means to deter or allure many from the Proteſtant Religion to his own.</p>
                     <p>As to Foraign aſſiſtances, no Prince will dare to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo many as ſhall totally over-power his own People, becauſe then they will be able to ruine him, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> did the <hi>Brittains;</hi> and he may be ſure they will do it. So that this is a ridiculous Suppoſition in a Prince of our own Nation that hath No other Dominions but theſe.</p>
                     <p>As to any Number of People that he may be able to bring over to his Religion, they will be very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in proportion to thoſe that will never be brought over, tho we ſuppoſe the Number greater then it is like to be; for that ſome men have got a way of Reproaching all they hate with the Name of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> becauſe there is none more hated than that; yet even for that caſe the Number muſt be ſmall, being very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Liſt themſelves in a hated Party, Except they may have great Advantages by it; which are not to be afforded to many (in proportion to the reſt) in one Kings Reign, in ſo ſmall a Kingdom as <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The very attempting this with Force and Violence, will drive ſo many people out of the Nation, that the Prince will deſtroy both his Revenue, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; which we may believe no man will do for his own ſake.</p>
                     <p>To this we may add, That it is three to one whether we have any ſuch Prince. Who but God can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever the Duke ſhall Survive his Majeſty. Whether, if he do, he ſhall be the Next Heir; and whether, if he be So, his Intereſt, the Grace of God, or meer humane
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56751:107"/>inconſtancy, may not work upon him to return to that Religion he was firſt principl'd in, and for which his Royal Father moſt Gloriouſly Laid down his Life.</p>
                     <p>And after all this, Suppoſing he ſhould Succeed and be Zealous for his <hi>Religion,</hi> and Suppoſe that to be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; there is no neceſſity that he muſt Act all the worſt Principles of Popery to the Utmoſt degree. I am ſure it is not uſual ſo to do, tho the difficulty be not ſo great as here it will be.</p>
                     <p>And after all, doth not the Providence of God govern the Popiſh as well as Proteſtant Princes? Is the Arm of the Almighty ſhortned that he can neither Deliver nor Support his Church? or hath he forſaken her in her Old Age, who preſerved her with So much Care and Power in her Infancy under Heathen Princes for above Three hundred Years? and under <hi>Arrian</hi> Princes (which were as bad as the worſt Papiſts) a long time after that. Do we believe this Proteſtant Religion is acceptable to him? Are the far greateſt part of them that profeſs it, Sincere or Falſe in their pretences? If all theſe be anſwered one way, we have Something to rely upon that is more Steady, than the Faith and Religion of Princes. If in the other, it will be but a folly to pretend to Secure by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Arts, that which God is reſolved to deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon upon which the Bill of Excluſion is built, is worſe than the thing. Firſt they Vote, <hi>That the Dukes being a Papiſt, and the Hopes of his Coming ſuch to the Crown, hath given the greateſt Countenance and Encouragement to the preſent Deſigns and Conſpiracies againſt the King and Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They Vote the Duke a Papiſt, which is more than any man living can tell but himſelf; and if it ſhould be granted that he is So, what then? Then this hath given the greateſt Countenance and Encouragement to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56751:107"/>preſent Deſigns and Conſpiracies againſt the King and Proteſtant Religion; and then the Concluſion is, That therefore he muſt be diſ-inherited. To me it ſeems bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Logick to ſay, Then all poſſible Care and Art is to be imployed to reduce him back to our Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this way of proceeding with him can end in nothing but the enraging and exaſperating of him againſt the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
                     <p>But then the Duke's being a Papiſt hath not given the greateſt, nor, if we may believe Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> hardly any Encouragement to the <hi>Plot:</hi> for he tells us,<note place="margin">Article <hi>60.</hi>
                        </note> that when he urged, <hi>That he feared the Death of the King would ſcarely do the buſineſs and effect the Deſign, unleſs his R. H. would pardon thoſe that did the buſineſs, and ſtand by them in it. Keines</hi> replyed, <hi>That the Duke was not the Strength of their Truſt; for they had another way to effect the ſetting up the C. R. &amp;c. And if</hi> James <hi>did not Comply with them, to pot he muſt go alſo.</hi> And Article 29. <hi>If the Duke ſhall ſet his face in the leaſt meaſure to follow his Brothers foot-ſteps, his Paſsport was made to Lay him aſleep.</hi> And Article 24. They the Jeſuits aver, <hi>That altho the Duke was a good Catholique, yet he had a tender affection for the King, and would ſcarcely be engaged in that Concern; and if they ſhould once intimate their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Purpoſes unto him, they might not onely be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of their Deſign, but alſo might loſe his Favour.</hi> Art. 16. He ſaith he putting this queſtion, <hi>What if the Duke ſhould prove Slippery?</hi> They replyed, <hi>His Paſsport was ready when ever he ſhould Appear to fail them.</hi> And page the 64. He tells us, <hi>He</hi> (the Pope) <hi>hath ordered, That in caſe the D. of</hi> York <hi>will not accept theſe Crowns as forfeited by his Brother unto the Pope, as of his Gift, and ſettle ſuch Prelates and Dignities in the Church, and ſuch Officers in Commands and Places Civil, Naval, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56751:108"/>Military, as he hath Commiſſioned, Extirpate the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and in order thereunto</hi> Ex poſt facto; <hi>Conſent the Aſſaſſination of the King his Brother, Maſſacre of his Proteſtant Subjects, Firing of his Towns, &amp;c. by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of the Aſſaſsins, Murtherers and Incendiaries, that then he alſo be Poyſoned or deſtroyed, after they have for ſome time abuſed his Name and Title to Strengthen their Plot, &amp;c.</hi> All which Paſſages in his and other of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives ſhew plainly the D. being a Papiſt was not the greater, nay it was hardly any encouragement to the <hi>Plot:</hi> and tho ſome of them have gone farther than Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> yet that ſhews the Jeſuits had different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of His R. Highneſs; and therefore had no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but if the <hi>Plot</hi> upon the Life of the King had ſucceeded, he might have revenged it upon them tho he were of their Religion as they believed.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe things may be diſputed both ways, Suppoſe I ſhould grant the Hopes of his Coming a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt to the Crown, did really give the greateſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the <hi>Plot;</hi> will diſ-inheriting him defeat thoſe hopes? No, but it will rather whet them on to do their utmoſt to Murther the King to prevent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that injury to the Duke: and of this the Houſe was ſo ſenſible, that the ſame day they paſſed this <hi>Vote,</hi> they <hi>Added</hi> to it this that followes.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved N. C.</p>
                        <p>That in Defence of the Kings Perſon and Government, and of the Protestant Religion, this Houſe doth declare, That they will Stand by His Majeſty with their Lives and Fortunes; and that if his Majeſty ſhall come by any Violent Death, (which God forbid) they will revenge it to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmoſt upon the Papiſts.</p>
                     </q>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56751:108"/>
                     <p>This latter Vote they have annexed to the former every time they have paſſed it, which ſhews they are ſenſible Revenge and Deſpair are full as likely to puſh them on, as Hope, to this Horrid attempt: and in that caſe this <hi>Vote</hi> will never hinder them, but it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Scotch</hi> Aſſaſſins to do it if they can; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Papiſts are to Suffer, who ever doth the fact.</p>
                     <p>So that to me it ſeems the Reaſons upon which the Bill is founded, are weak and unconcluding, and that no Malice could have Contrived a more effectual way to haſten thoſe Calamities upon us it pretends to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and to aſcertain what is full as likely never to happen without it.</p>
                     <p>So I conclude the Lords did well and wiſely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Bill, and the Biſhops in joyning with them ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>And now I will proceed with the reſt of the <hi>Votes,</hi> having made this ſhort Digreſſion to Expreſs my thoughts on this great affair, which I ſubmit to the Judgment of wiſer men; and ſhall willingly retract or amend any thing if I have erred; for I ſeek nothing by all this but the Peace and Proſperity of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                     <p>There being little done of importance on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>18th</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> the next day the Commons fell upon the buſineſs of the Abhorrers of the Petitions; and began with the Grand-Juries for the Counties of <hi>Somerſet</hi> and <hi>Devon,</hi> which had both deteſted and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the ſaid Tumultuous Petition. So they Ordered, That Sir <hi>Giles Philips</hi> and <hi>William Coleman,</hi> being the Fore-men of the ſaid <hi>Grand-Juries,</hi> ſhould be ſent for in Cuſtody of the Serjeant at Arms attending their Houſe, to anſwer at the Bar of their Houſe, for Breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge by them committed againſt their <hi>Houſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56751:109"/>
                     <p>Before in Sir <hi>George Jeffereys</hi> Caſe, it was for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Rights of the Subject,</hi> and Now 'tis become a <hi>Priviledge of Parliament</hi> for the People to Petition by Hundreds and Thouſands for the Sitting of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At this rate of Proceeding, there will be Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament enough at laſt.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time they ordered Captain <hi>William Caſtle</hi> and Mr. <hi>John Hutchinſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henry Walrond,</hi> the two laſt being of the ſaid <hi>Grand-Juries,</hi> to be Sent for in Cuſtody too. So this was a pretty handſom begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>But the next day they found that Mr. <hi>William Stawell</hi> was Fore-man for the Grand-Jury for <hi>Devon,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> ſo they ordered his Name to be put out of the Warrant, and Mr. <hi>Stawell</hi>'s to be put in. This ſhews with what heat and haſte they managed this affair.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould the Fore-men of the Grand-Juries be ſent for, rather than all or any of the reſt; the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having no more Authority than the Laſt man, nor being any way inabled by his place to Help or Hinder any thing, but being Concluded by the Major part, be his own Opinion what it will? but they could not tell who promoted this affair, and therefore Right or Wrong, Singled them out to be made Examples, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it convenient to ſend for the whole Number, who yet, were puniſhed in theſe; and not only they that ſuffered, but every Gentleman in the Nation ſuffer'd in them; their Liberties being at the Mercy of every Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, who when they pleaſe may ſend Taylors, Grocers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enjoy theſe exorbitant priviledges, and Send for the beſt Knights and Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> for not, having payd reſpects great enough to them.</p>

                     <p>The Bill of Importation of Cattel from <hi>Scotland</hi> was read the ſecond time, and Committed.</p>
                     <p>Then they proceeded in the buſineſs of the <hi>Abhorrers,</hi> and Voted, That one <hi>Thomas Herbert</hi> Eſq; ſhould be ſent for in Cuſtody, for proſecuting <hi>John Arnold</hi> Eſq; at the Council Table, for promoting the ſaid Petition, and procuring Subſcriptions.</p>
                     <p>To him they added Sir <hi>Thomas Holt,</hi> Serjeant at Law, and Mr. <hi>Thomas Staples,</hi> as Betrayers of the Liberties of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day one <hi>Eld</hi> was diſcharged out of Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; who had been taken for not Making a good Search for Arms at the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Taxall</hi> in <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> Notice being taken that he was a <hi>Sober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant,</hi> (what that means I muſt leave to my Reader; for I never heard that any ſort of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> made Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, or Debauchery, or any other ſort of Inſobriety a part of <hi>Proteſtantiſme,</hi> and I ſhould have liked it better if it had been a <hi>Confiding Man,</hi>) and an Enemy to the Popiſh Faction: It were worth the while to enquire how he ſtood affected to the <hi>Puritan Faction.</hi>

                     <p>Two Bills for Regulating Elections were read the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and Committed to a Committee to unite or divide them as they ſhould ſee cauſe.</p>
                     <p>The day following Sir <hi>Thomas Holt</hi> petitioning the Houſe, was called in and Cenſured upon his Knees, and Diſcharged.</p>

                     <p>The ſame day a Bill was brought in for Repeal of an <hi>ACT</hi> made in the 35 of <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 1.

                     <p>The whole is a Tragical repreſentation of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that Popery had gotten over the Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Aſsiſted</hi> (as they tell us) <hi>by the Treachery of perfidious Proteſtants,</hi> which muſt be the Diſſenters, by whoſe aſsiſtance they obtained the Toleration, broke ſeveral Seſsions of the Long Loyal Parliament, if <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Letter to Monſieur <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> may be Credited; and it may truly be averred, that the Papiſts have not obtained any Advantage without the Diſſenters, nor the Diſſenters without them.</p>
                     <p>They ſay further, <hi>That the ACT of Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning a</hi> Teſt <hi>to be taken by all perſons admitted into any Publick Office, and intended for a Security againſt Papiſts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56751:111"/>coming into Imployment, had So little effect, that either by diſpenſations, obtained from</hi> Rome, <hi>they Submitted to thoſe</hi> Teſts, <hi>and held their Offices themſelves. or thoſe put into thoſe Places, wore ſo favourable to the ſame Intereſt, that Popery it ſelf has rather gained than loſt ground ſince that ACT.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Suppoſing it true, that ſome of them did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch diſpenſations, what was this to his Majeſty; and if any of them that gat their Offices were apt to afford them unlawful favours, they might have called them to account for it, with much more general Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than they did the <hi>Abhorrers:</hi> but let any man that Knowes any thing of the World, Judge whether the Malice or falſehood of the Concluſion be greateſt.</p>
                     <p>They tell the King a dreadful Story of the defeating of the Preſentment intended againſt his Majeſties Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> under whoſe Countenance all the reſt (of the Papiſts) ſhelter themſelves, as they ſay. But ſurely his Majeſty was not to be informed what they thought of this, who could not but be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Fact long ſince; and ſo they deſcend to the buſineſs of the <hi>Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome,</hi> which Expoſes <hi>Popery</hi> (<hi>as it deſerves,</hi> ſay they) as Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the People; and they tell his Majeſty, <hi>That a New and Arbitrary Rule of Court was made in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Court of</hi> Kings-Bench, <hi>That the ſame for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould not be Printed by any perſon whatſoever.</hi> But then they take no Notice how that Author has made many Odious, Falſe, and Scandalous, Reflections upon the Religion and Government by Law Eſtabliſhed; which was the cauſe why it was Suppreſt, and not any talent he had of writing againſt <hi>Popery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, They tell the King that they have freed themſelves from the guilt of that blood and deſolation
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56751:112"/>which is like to enſue: which is an Expreſsion in that place that looks like a kind of Threat or Menace; for there was then No proſpect of blood or deſolation that could ariſe from any cauſe or perſons but what muſt be Countenanced by the Diſſenters.</p>
                     <p>The Concluſion is; <hi>But our Onely hope, next under God, is in Your Sacred Majeſty, that by your Great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Goodneſs we may be effectually Secured from Popery, and all the Evils that attend it, and that none but perſons of Known Fidelity to Your Majeſty, and Sincere Affection to The Proteſtant Religion,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</note> 
                        <hi>may be put into any Imployment Civil or Military. That whilſt we ſhall give a Supply to</hi> Tangier, <hi>we may be aſſured we do not Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Strength of our Popiſh Adverſaries, nor encreaſe our own Dangers; which Deſires of your Faithful Commons if Your Majesty ſhall Graciouſly vouchſafe to grant, we ſhall not onely be ready to aſsiſt Your Majeſty in defence of</hi> Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier, <hi>but do whatſoever elſe ſhall be in our power to enable Your Majeſty to Protect the Proteſtant Religion and Intereſt at home and abroad, and to reſiſt and repel the Attempts of Your Majeſties and the Kingdoms Enemies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But His Majeſty notwithſtanding continued without any Supply, and by the Bleſſing of God preſerved the Town. Now it is very obſervable, that in the former Parliament there being a Report, <hi>That</hi> Tangier <hi>ſhould be Sold to relieve the Neceſsities of the Crown,</hi> they then Voted,<note place="margin">April 9. 1679.</note> 
                        <hi>That the Houſe was of Opinion, That thoſe who ſhould Adviſe His Majeſty to part with</hi> Tangier <hi>to any Foraign Prince or State, or be Inſtrumental therein, ought to be accounted Enemies to the King and Kingdom:</hi> And yet now that it was in apparent hazard to be loſt to the <hi>Moors,</hi> the Sworn Enemies of all Chriſtians, they would grant nothing to preſerve it; and many of the <hi>Commons</hi> in their Speeches were of Opinion, that it was the beſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56751:112"/>way to deſert the Town. So that if any did Adviſe his Majeſty to Sell the Place, they were Enemies to the King and Kingdom; but if it were loſt or deſerted, So the King had nothing for it, the Matter was not much, ſo that the King might bear the blame, tho the Commons were in the fault.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ESDAT</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Tryal of <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford</hi> was began, which laſted till the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> of which I ſhall take no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it being printed by it Self. During all which time there was nothing material done by the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons except that buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>But very remarkable was their <hi>Severity</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Sheridon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Day,</hi> who were Ordered to be taken into Cuſtody, their Papers to be Searched, and that No perſon ſhould be Admitted to come to them, but ſuch as ſhould have occaſion to bring them Neceſſaries.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Then they Voted, That the Impriſonment of one <hi>Peter Norris</hi> at <hi>Dover</hi> by the Order of Sir <hi>Leoline Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi>

                     <p>When ever any Law paſs againſt <hi>ſuſpected Papiſts,</hi> great care ought to be taken to limit that Looſe term, or great Miſchiefs will inſue.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> Complaint was made, That one <hi>Herbert Herring</hi> who had been order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken into Cuſtody for a Breach of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> did abſcond himſelf to avoid the Execution of the ſaid Order: whereupon it was</p>

                     <p>This was a way never to want Work, if every Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Attorney or Porter that had broke the Priviledge of the Houſe, was to be brought in by Bill.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> a Member of their Houſe, was the Next that fell under their diſpleaſure, being ſaid to <hi>Have had Secret Negotiation with the Duke of</hi> Y. <hi>by the Means of the Earl of</hi> Peterborough, <hi>Mrs.</hi> Cellier, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>at ſuch time as they were turning the Popiſh Plot upon the Proteſtants, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it ſeems they are <hi>THE Proteſtants.</hi> For which he was Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered (after his defence) to be Expelled the Houſe, and to be brought to the Bar to receive the Cenſure of the Houſe upon his Knees from the <hi>Speaker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which was done with ſo little reſpect to the Quality of the perſon; that after the Diſſolution of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſent the Speaker a Challenge, for which he was Committed, having been before committed to the <hi>Serjeant,</hi> for not being at hand when it ſhould have been firſt done, by the Speaker. So he was twice Committed and Expell'd too, but by what Law, the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>proceeded, I know not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the Intereſt both of the Members and of Us whom they repreſent, to take care that this be not left to them; for here was a Member Expelled not for being a party to that Conſpiracy of the Papiſts, but for having <hi>Secret Negotiations</hi> with the <hi>Duke of York</hi> at that time: and if this be allowed, that they may Expel for what cauſe they pleaſe, be there Law, or be there none, then have the greater part of the Houſe an Abſolute and Arbitrary power over the leſſer part; and if either Side do by accident get the Advantage of the other by a Single <hi>Vote,</hi> they may Expel them as they pleaſe: which muſt Neceſſarily end in Confuſion and Slavery.</p>

                        <p>Reſolved N. C.

                     </q>
                     <p>And ordered a <hi>Committee</hi> to be appointed to prepare and bring in a Bill purſuant to the firſt of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves.</p>
                     <p>The latter was taken up to Supply the Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which bad been thrown out by the Lords, and was never proſecuted any further; for when they came to draw the Bill, it was found impracticable, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving us preſently in a Civil War.</p>
                     <p>For an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> ſignifies nothing without a Head to govern and direct it; if the King be made the Head, then we are where we were, and it is to no purpoſe; If another perſon be made So, then there is two diſtinct Governments in the ſame Kingdom, which can never ſtand together a Month without imbroyling themſelves and the People. This the <hi>Holy League of France</hi> proved Experimentally true; and the ſame Event will always follow.</p>

                     <p>Beſides, there was no reaſon to Expect that either his Majeſty or the Houſe of Lords would yield to this way of Excluſion, which was worſe than the former; Tho if that had paſſed, it would have ſignified nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Aſſociation or a Standing Army, as the Author of the <hi>Seaſonable Addreſs to both Houſes of Parliament</hi> hath well proved.</p>

                           <p>AT the Opening of this Parliament, I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the Alliances I had made with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> as the beſt Meaſures that could be taken for the Safety of <hi>England</hi> and the Repoſe of Chriſtendom.</p>
                           <p>But I told you withall, That if Our <hi>Friendſhip</hi> became Unſafe to truſt to, it would not be wondred at, if Our Neighbours ſhould begin to take new Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and perhaps ſuch as might be fatal to Us.</p>
                           <p>I must tell you, That Our Allies cannot but ſee how little hath been done ſince this Meeting, to Encourage their Dependance upon Us; and I find by them, That Unleſs We can be So United at home, as to make Our Alliance valuable to them, it will not be poſsible to Hinder them from Seeking ſome other Refuge, and making Such New <hi>Friendſhips,</hi> as will not be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Our Safety. Conſider, that a <hi>Neglect of this Opportunity is Never to be repaired.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I did likewiſe lay the Matter plainly before You, touching the Eſtate and Condition of <hi>Tangier,</hi> I must Now tell you again, That if that Place be thought worth the Keeping, you muſt take ſuch Conſideration
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56751:117"/>of it, that it may be ſpeedily Supply'd, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for Me to Preſerve it at an Expence ſo far above My Power.</p>
                           <p>I did promiſe you the fulleſt Satisfaction your Hearts could wiſh, for the Security of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and to Concur with you in any Remedies, Which might conſiſt with Preſerving the Succeſsion of the Crown in its Due and Legal Courſe of Deſcent: and I do again with the ſame Reſervations, renew the ſame Promiſes to You.</p>

                           <p>That your Majeſties Sacred Life is in Continual Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger under the Proſpect of a Popiſh Succeſſor, is evident,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56751:118"/>not onely from the Principles of thoſe devoted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which allow that an Heretical Prince (and ſuch they term all Proteſtant Princes) Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and depoſed by the Pope, may be Deſtroyed and Murther'd;<note place="margin">The ſame Principles varied in but one circumſtance, are owned by the Diſſenters and Common-Wealth Party, who are ſet up by the Excluſion as much as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are defeated, which ought to be conſidered at the ſame time.</note> but alſo from the Teſtimonies given in the proſecution of the Horrid Popiſh Plot, againſt divers <hi>Traytors</hi> Attainted for deſigning to put thoſe accurſed Principles into practice againſt Your Majeſty.</p>
                           <p>From the Expectation of this Succeſſion, has the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Papiſts in Your Majeſties Dominions ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed within theſe few Years, and ſo many been prevailed with to deſert the true Proteſtant Religion, that they might be prepared for the Favours of a Popiſh Prince as ſoon as he ſhould come to the poſſeſsion of the Crown:<note place="margin">The ſame inconveniences have ariſen from the Expectation of another <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> &amp; <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.</hi>

                           <p>This is that hath hardned the Papiſts of this Kingdom, Animated and Confederated by their Prieſts aod Jeſuits, to make a Common Purſe, Provide Arms, Make Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Foreign Princes, and Solicit their Aid, for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Popery upon us; and all this even during Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Reign, and whileſt Your Majesties Government and the Laws were our Protection.</p>
                           <p>It is Your Majeſties Glory and True Intereſt to be the Head and Protector of all Proteſtants,<note place="margin">It is mpoſſible for his Majeſty to preſerve this Glory, but by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his Kingly Dignity and Power, which is the foundation of the other; and the Attempts of the Common-wealth Party and the Diſſenters, hath more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his Majeſties Allies abroad, and his true Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects at home, Then either the Number of Popiſh Converts, the Plot, or the Fears or Hopes of a Popiſh Succeſſor.</note> as well Abroad as at Home: but if theſe Hopes remain, what Alliances can be made for the Advantage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56751:118"/>Religion and Intereſt, which ſhall give Confidence to Your Majeſties Allies, to joyn ſo vigorouſly with your Majeſty, as the State of that Intereſt in the World now requires, whileſt they ſee this Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in ſo much danger of a Popiſh Succeſſor, by whom at the preſent all their Councils and Actions may be Eluded, as hitherto they have been, and by whom (if he ſhould Succeed) they are Sure to be deſtroyed.</p>
                           <p>WE have thus humbly layd before your Majeſty, ſome of thoſe great Dangers and Miſchiefs which evidently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Expectation of a Popiſh Succeſſor. The Certain and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſpeakable Evils which will come upon Your Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects and their Poſterity, if ſuch a Prince ſhould Inherit, are more alſo than we can well enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                           <p>Our Religion,<note place="margin">No, may not the Providence of God, and the Number and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of its Profeſſors defend and preſerve the beſt Religion in the World during the Reign of one Popiſh Prince, when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery hath preſerved it Self under Four Princes together of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</note> which is now ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſhaken will then be totally Overthrown; Nothing will be left, or can be found to protect or defend it.</p>
                           <p>The Execution of all Old Laws muſt ceaſe, and it will be in vain to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect New Ones.

                           <p>In the Reign of ſuch a Prince the Pope will be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Supream,<note place="margin">What ſhall the Pope be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the King now is Supream in all Cauſes, as well Temporal as Eccleſiaſtical? Can any man that will ſtick to his Oath, be forced to acknowledg this New minted Papal Supremacy, which never had any being but onely in St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Patrimony, where the Pope is a Temporal Prince? Muſt all Caſes forthwith be drawn under his Juriſdiction? Then Wo be to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall.</note> (though the Subjects have Sworn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) and all Cauſes either as Spiritual, or in order to Spiritual things, will be brought under his Juriſdiction.</p>
                           <p>The Lives<note place="margin">Had the Houſe any Prophets amongſt them to fore-ſee this?

                           <p>To all this we might Add; That it appears in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the <hi>Plot,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Who invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Princes Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance? Who uſed theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?

                           <p>We further humbly beſeech Your Majeſty in your Great Wiſdom to Conſider,<note place="margin">It is not likely but that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did think of this before this <hi>Addreſs</hi> had a being; and they ſhould do well to Conſider, That the Nature and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation is Such, as Experience ſhewed us in the late Times, That an abſolute Monarchy may be much more Eaſily Set up and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued amongſt us, than a <hi>Common-Wealth;</hi> and therefore it is as poſſible that in caſe of Such an Oppoſition, the Duke may prevail and become Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute it he pleaſe, as that he ſhould be Overcome; and it is much more probable that this Royal Line will finally prevail, if he do not, and obtain the Succeſſion, then that an <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> will be able to Settle it in a New Family, whom all will Hate and Envy. And it ought alſo to be Conſidered, <hi>France</hi> may Strike in and Settle The Monarchy, Duke, Popery and Arbitrary Government, in caſe of oppoſition, which is not likely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: Or it May be may endeavour to get the Crown for himſelf or his Brother. However, Rebellion and Civil War are as deſtructive as Popery, and therefore Never to be choſen.</note> Whether in Caſe the Imperial Crown of this Proteſtant Kingdom, ſhould deſcend to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> the oppoſition which may poſsibly be made to his poſſeſsing it, may not onely Endanger the further deſcent in the Royal Line, But even Monarchy it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>For theſe Reaſons we are most humble Petitioners to Your moſt ſacred Majesty;<note place="margin">I ſhall in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhew his Majeſty had much better Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration to his Poor Proteſtant Subjects, to deny their Petition and ſtick to the Reſervation, tho I believe he may grant their Bill when it be tender'd in a Parliamentary way.

                           <opener>
                              <salute>Sir,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I have ſpent much of my time in ſtudying the Laws of this Land, and I pretend to know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Law of Foreign Countries, as Well as of our own; and I have upon this occaſion well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of them, but cannot find how we can Juſtifie the paſſing of this Bill, rather much againſt it.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, I think it contrary to Natural Juſtice, that We ſhould proceed to Condemnation not only before Conviction, but before we have heard the Party, or Examined any Witneſs about him, I am ſure none in his defence. And to do this, by making a New Law of purpoſe, when you have Old Laws in being that have appointed a Puniſhment to his Crime, I humbly conceive is very Severe, and contrary to the uſual Proceedings of this Houſe, and the Birth-Right of every Engliſh-man.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, I think it is Contrary to the Principles of Our Religion, that we ſhould diſpoſſeſs a man of his Birth-Right, becauſe he differs (from us) in point of Faith. For it is not agreed by all, that Dominion is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56751:122"/>ſounded in Grace. For my part, I think there is more of Popery in this Bill, than there can poſſibly be in the Nation without it; for none but <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men</hi> did ever go about to diſ-inherit men for their Religion.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, I am of opinion that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have their Right from God alone, and that no Power on Earth can deprive them of it. And I hope this Houſe will not attempt to do any thing, which is ſo preciſely contrary not only to the Law of God, but the Law of the Land too. For if this Bill ſhould paſs, it would Change the Eſſence of the Monarchy, and Make the Crown <hi>Elective.</hi> For by the ſame reaſon that this Parliament may diſ-inherit this Prince for his Religion; other Parliaments may diſ-inherit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, upon ſome other pretence which they may Suggeſt, and ſo Conſequently by ſuch Excluſions elect whom they pleaſe.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, It is againſt the Oath of Allegiance, taken in its own ſenſe, without Jeſuitical Evaſions: For by binding all perſons to the King, his Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, the Duke as <hi>Preſumptive. Heir</hi> muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And I am of opinion that it cannot be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withal. <hi>Sir,</hi> I will be very cautious how I diſpute the Power of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> I know the <hi>Legiſlative</hi> is very great, and it ought to be ſo: But yet I am of opinion, That Parliaments cannot diſ-inherit the Heir of the Crown, and that if ſuch an <hi>ACT</hi> ſhould paſs, it would be invalid in it ſelf. And therefore I hope it will not ſeem ſtrange, that I ſhould offer my Judgment againſt this Bill, while it is in <hi>Debate,</hi> in which I think I do that which is my Duty as a Member of this Houſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> was a Proteſtant, his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56751:122"/>People moſt Papiſts, who uſed ſome endeavours, to prevent his coming to the Crown; but when they found they were not likely to perfect their deſign without occaſioning a Civil War, they deſiſted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that a Civil War would probably bring on them more miſery than a King of a different Religion, and therefore Submitted. <hi>Sir,</hi> I hope we ſhall not permit our Paſſions to Guide us inſtead of Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus far that Great Perſon.</p>

                     </floatingText>
                     <p>To theſe Reaſons if we pleaſe to add this other, That it is ſo far from preventing our Calamities, that it will Aſcertain them at his Majeſties Death with the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Civil War, and in all likelyhood bring that upon us before that time; for ſo ſoon as ever the Bill paſs, the Duke will have a Right to make a War upon <hi>England</hi> even in his Majeſty's Life-time; and what may be the event of that, God onely Knows. However, to prevent Surprize, there muſt be <hi>A Standing Army</hi> or an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> Kept up as long as the Duke Lives; and what the Conſequences of them are, may be foreſeen without difficulty; the firſt Ruining the Liberties of the People, and the Second Endangering the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Crown; and both of them in the divided Condition <hi>England</hi> now is, in point of Religion, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to raiſe ſuch Fears and Jealouſies, as will be almoſt as Uneaſie and as Unſafe as a Popiſh Succeſſor; and all this brought upon us immediately; whereas the other is future and Contingent.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 23<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Commons <hi>Ordered,</hi> That the <hi>Thanks of the Houſe</hi> ſhould be given to Dr. <hi>Burnett</hi> for his Sermon Preached the day before, and likewiſe for his Book relating to the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Reformation of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and that he be deſired to Print his ſaid Sermon, And
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56751:123"/>on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following, they Voted that he ſhould <hi>be deſired to proceed with and Compleat that good Work by him begun, in Writing the Hiſtory of the</hi> Reformation <hi>of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
                     <p>They <hi>Ordered,</hi> That Leave ſhould be given to bring in a Bill or Bills to <hi>Correct and Puniſh Atheiſme, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Swearing and Debauchery, and for the better Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lords Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſeveral other Crimes have grown and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon this Nation for want of a Church Diſcipline, and by reaſon of the Diviſions amongſt us in Points of Religion; and till theſe things be taken care of, all Laws againſt them will ſignifie Nothing. Yet it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Government from the guilt of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is heartily to be wiſhed, that Care may be taken to perfect this good Deſign; and when further Care is taken of the Lords Day, ſome care would be taken of the other Feaſts and Faſts by Law Eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This day alſo the Lords returned the <hi>Additional Act</hi> for Burying in Woollen, paſſed without Amendment.</p>
                     <p>And by another Meſſage Certified to the Commons, <hi>That at their Riſing they would Adjourn to the Next</hi> Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>Seven-night after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And by another Meſſage they ſent down Mr. <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>'s Anſwer to the Articles of Impeachment againſt him.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the <hi>Commons</hi> alſo paſſed a Vote of an Extraordinary Nature, which was as followeth.</p>
                     <q>Reſolved, That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, That Mr. <hi>Joſeph Brown</hi> ought to be reſtored to all the Offices and Places which were taken from him, by occaſion of a Judgment given againſt him in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term <hi>29 Caroli Secundi,</hi> upon an Information
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56751:123"/>for publiſhing an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlicenſed Book, called, <hi>The Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Diſſolved.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>Theſe Sorts of Writers were Now to be encouraged what might be, but what Benefit <hi>Brown</hi> had by this <hi>Vote,</hi> I never heard.</p>
                     <p>But the Next day being the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> they took occaſion to Chaſtiſe one <hi>Richard Thompſon</hi> Clerk, very <hi>Severely;</hi> for he having been Complained of by ſome of the Diſſenters who were Now the White Boys, and the Sober Loyal Proteſtants; and it having been remitted to a <hi>Committee</hi> to enquire into his Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, the Houſe upon the return of the <hi>Committee,</hi> paſſed theſe <hi>Votes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſelved N. C. That <hi>Richard Thompſon</hi> Clerk, has publickly defamed His Sacred Majesty, Preached Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Vilified the Reformation, Promoted Popery by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting Popiſh Principles, Decrying the Popiſh Plot, and turning the ſame upon the Proteſtants, and endeavoured to Subvert the Liberty and Property of the Subject, and the Rights and Priviledges of the Parliament; and that he is a Scandal and Reproach to his Function.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved, That he be Impeached, and a Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to prepare the ſaid Impeachment, and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and the Reſolution of the Houſe thereupon be forthwith Printed.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This <hi>Thompſon</hi> was accuſed for ſeveral Expreſſions both in Preaching and Diſcourſe: But they moſtly fixed upon a Sermon Preached the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1679.<note place="margin">See the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Papers.</note> wherein he ſaid (it ſeems) the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were ſuch perſons as the Devil Bluſht at Accuſed <hi>Hamden</hi> for choc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Rebel rather than pay the <hi>Ship-Money;</hi> which he ſaid was the King's Right by Law. Accuſed Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> to have been the firſt that Preached the <hi>King-Killing</hi> Doctrine: And from thence inferred, That a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56751:124"/>Presbyterian <hi>qua talis</hi> is as great a <hi>Traytor as any Prieſt or Jeſuit:</hi> But one Witneſs ſaith he ſaid, <hi>Worſe.</hi> And that he had alſo frequently caſt Evil Aſperſions againſt <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Divines at</hi> Briſtol <hi>of Great Note,</hi> viz. Mr. <hi>Chetwind,</hi> Mr. <hi>Standfaſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Croſsman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Palmer</hi> and others, ſaying, <hi>That ſuch as went to their Lectures</hi> were <hi>the Brats of the Devil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he had ſpoken in Sermons and elſewhere, ſeveral hard Things againſt the Petitions for the Sitting of the Parliament; as, <hi>That it was the Seed of Rebellion,</hi> and like to 41. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he had ſaid, <hi>There was great Noiſe of a Popiſh Plot, but there was Nothing in it but a Presbyterian Plot,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He was Accuſed to have approved of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Points of <hi>Juſtification, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſsion, Penance, Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> and <hi>Criſme,</hi> in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Single Life of the Clergy;</hi> ſaying, <hi>That if he were as well Satisfied of other things as he was of theſe, he would not have been ſo long Separated from the Catholick Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. He had ſpoken (as they ſaid) ſome ill things of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> as <hi>Church-Robbers;</hi> and againſt his Majeſty too; which tho I care not to repeat, yet they are nothing in compariſon to what the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have publiſhed in Print againſt his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>What Anſwer the Man would have made for himſelf, I know not, for the Parliament never brought him to an hearing.</p>
                     <p>But upon inquiry, I find, notwithſtanding all this Clamour, the Man hath a great and good Report, for his Piety, Learning and Prudence; but his Zeal for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Eſtabliſhed, drew this Storm upon him from the Exaſperated Diſſenters; who never ſtick thus to blaſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56751:124"/>the Fame of Good Men when it ſerves their ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
                     <p>But to return from this Digreſſion. The Bill for Exempting his Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant Subjects diſſenting from the Church of</hi> England <hi>from the Penalties of Certain Laws,</hi> was read a ſecond time, and Committed upon a Debate of the Houſe to the <hi>Committee</hi> to whom the Bill for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting</hi> of his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon a Debate of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Then the Bill for Baniſhing the Papiſts out of the King's Dominions, was read a ſecond time, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the Debate of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Then the Houſe adjourned till <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>December.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That day the Houſe met and Ordered, That the Committee appointed to prepare Evidence againſt the 4.

                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved, That the ſeveral Writings, Papers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings relating to ſuch Members of the late Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as received Allowances out of the Moneys appointed for Secret Services, be produced to this Houſe.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved N. C. That no Member of this Houſe ſhall accept of any Office or Place of Profit from the Crown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Leave of the Houſe, or any Promiſe of any ſuch Office or Place of Profit during ſuch time as he ſhall continue a Member of the Houſe, and that the offenders herein ſhall be Expelled.</p>

                     <p>It ſeems they had diſcovered that ſome of their Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous men were Selling themſelves to the Court-Party for Preferment, and prepared this <hi>Vote</hi> to keep the Party together.</p>

                     <p>Leave was alſo given to bring in a Bill for Regulating the abuſes in making Casks, Barrels, and other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. And</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ordered</hi> alſo, That Leave be given to bring in a Bill for a <hi>General Naturalization of Alien-Proteſtants,</hi> and allowing them liberty to Exerciſe their <hi>Trades</hi> in all Corporations.</p>
                     <p>A Bill for <hi>Relief of the Subjects againſt Arbitrary Fines,</hi> was read a ſecond time and committed.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Richard Thompſon</hi> was Ordered upon his Petition to give ſufficient Security for his forth-coming to the Serjeant at Arms attending that Houſe, to Anſwer to the Impeachment againſt him; and ſo was diſcharged of his Impriſonment.</p>
                     <p>I can ſee No reaſon why he ſhould be proſecuted by an Impeachment in Parliament. It being beneath the Dignity of the Houſes to Concern themſelves with ſuch a man as Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> muſt needs be, who might much better have been proceeded againſt in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56751:126"/>or Civil Courts, (if the Accuſations were all True;) but that his Blaſpheming <hi>Calvin</hi> and the Loyal Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Proteſtants, would have ſignified Nothing there; as I believe they would not before the Lords, if he had been Tryed.</p>
                     <p>Formerly the Commons impeached none but ſuch as were too great to be proſecuted any where elſe; and that but rarely, and upon great Neceſſity: This made them Venerable and Dreadful; but this Courſe for Small or No faults to impeach and impriſon great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Mean People which they followed in this Seſſion, tended to Nothing but the Waſting their time: and Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering greater Affairs to the damage of the King and Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>The ſame day the Commons agreed an Impeachment againſt Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> Knight, Chief Juſtice of the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench;</hi> and Ordered others to be drawn againſt Sir <hi>Francis North</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Jones,</hi> one of the Juſtices of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> one of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> So they were reſolved to find themſelves work, tho they had refuſed to do the King's Buſineſs till that was granted, which was impoſſible to be had this Seſsion of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> A Bill for the more Eaſie Collecting the Duty of Hearth-Money was read a ſecond time and committed upon the Debate of the Houſe,</p>
                     <p>A Bill for Repealing the <hi>Act</hi> for the <hi>Well-Governing of Corporations,</hi> was read the ſecond time and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Philip Skippon</hi> was Excuſed from being taken into Cuſtody for his Default in not attending the Houſe in the Call there of the <hi>Tueſday</hi> before.</p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:56751:127"/>
                     <p>Colonel <hi>Birch</hi> reporting from the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive Informations relating to the <hi>Popiſh Plott</hi> in <hi>Ireland, That the Committee, having proceeded upon the Matters to them referred, had taken ſeveral Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and received the Anſwer of Sir</hi> John Davis, <hi>and had alſo peruſed ſeveral Informations tranſmitted from the Houſe of Lords relating to the ſaid Plott.</hi> All which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered the ſame in at the Clerks Table, where the ſame were again read.</p>
                     <p>The Houſe then took into Conſideration the Meſſage ſent from the Lords the <hi>Tueſday</hi> before, wherein they deſired the Concurrence of the Houſe, and Reſolved,</p>
                     <q>That the Houſe did agree with the Lords, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theſe Words, That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> being a Papiſt, and the Expectation of his coming to the Crown, hath given the Greateſt Countenance and Encouragement thereto, as well as to the Horrid Popiſh Plot in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>And they reſolved to deliver the ſaid <hi>Vote</hi> to the Lords at a Conference, and Appointed a Committee to draw up Reaſons to be offered at the ſaid Conference.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Ordered, That the ſeveral Informations of <hi>John Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namara, Maurice Fitz-Gerrald,</hi> and <hi>James Maſh,</hi> that day read to the Houſe, relating to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot, be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Printed.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved, That <hi>Rich.

                     </q>
                     <p>And further <q>Ordered, That the Committee appointed to prepare the Evidence againſt the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> do prepare the ſaid Impeachment.</q>
                     </p>
                     <q>Ordered, That the further Conſideration of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56751:127"/>in relation to <hi>Arthur</hi> Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi> and Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi> be Adjourned to <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning next at Ten of the Clock in a full Houſe.</q>
                     <p>When it was Adjourned to <hi>Munday</hi> following, which was their laſt day, and gave them occaſion for other Thoughts.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> day of <hi>January.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ingroſſed Articles of Impeachment againſt Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> were Read, and ſent up to the Lords by the Lord <hi>Cavendiſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Bill to prevent <hi>Vexatious Actions,</hi> was read the firſt time, and Ordered a ſecond reading.</p>
                     <p>A Bill to prevent the Symony of one perſon from prejudicing another, was read the firſt time, and Ordered a ſecond reading.</p>
                     <p>The Bill of Diſcovery of Settlements of Eſtates for Superſtitious Uſes, was read the ſecond time and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon the debate of the Houſe.</p>
                     <p>Then the Houſe according to their Order, entred into Conſideration of his Majeſty's Meſſage ſent to the Houſe the <hi>Tueſday</hi> before; and <hi>Voted</hi> as followeth.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved, That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, That there is no Security or Safety for the Proteſtant Religion, the King's Life, or the Well Constituted and Eſtabliſhed Government of this Kingdom, without paſſing a Bill for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> to Inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereunto belonging; and to rely upon any other means or remedies, without ſuch a Bill, is not onely Inſufficient but dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved, That his Majesty in his last Meſſage having aſſured this Houſe of his readineſs to Concur in all other means for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, this Houſe doth declare, That until a Bill be likewiſe paſſed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56751:128"/>for Excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> this Houſe cannot give any Supply to his Majeſty, without Danger to his Majeſties Perſon, Extream Hazard of the Proteſtant Religion, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs to Thoſe by whom this Houſe is truſted.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>It ſeems the loſs of <hi>Tangier</hi> and of all our Alliances abroad, did not at all Hazard the Proteſtant Religion, or Endanger his Majeſties Perſon.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved, That all Perſons who Adviſed his Majeſty in his laſt Meſſage to this Houſe, to inſiſt upon an Opinion againſt the Bill for Excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Have given pernicious Counſel to his Majeſty, and <hi>Are Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Popery, and Enemies to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Reſolved, That <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Halifax, Henry</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> Henry Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this Houſe are perſons who Adviſed his Majeſty in his laſt Meſſage to this Houſe, to inſiſt upon an Opinion againſt the Bill for Excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and have therein given pernicious Counſel to his Majeſty, and are Promoters of Popery, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved, That an Humble Addreſs be preſented to his Majeſty, to remove <hi>Lawrence Hide</hi> Eſq: from his Majeſties Councils and Preſence, and from his Office in the Treaſury for ever.</p>
                        <p>Reſolved, That an Humble Addreſs be preſented to his Majesty, to remove <hi>Henry</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> from his Preſence and Councils, and all the Offices and Imployments of Honour and Profit, for ever.</p>

Reſolved, That an Humble Addreſs be made to his Majesty, to remove him from all Military Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56751:128"/>and Commands, and from all other Publick Offices and Imployments, and from his Majeſties Councils and Preſence for ever.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>But here was no Addreſſes Voted againſt <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Halyfax,</hi> nor <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Clarendon.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Having taken all this care to Chaſtiſe the Great Men, who as they believed had oppoſed them in this great buſineſs; in the Next place they undertook to Chaſtiſe his Majeſty Himſelf, and if their deſign had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as it is to be hoped it Never will, his Majeſty and all his Succeſſors ſhould have Known what it is to Anger a Houſe of Commons. However they meant well; for they</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Reſolved, <hi>That whoever ſhould hereafter</hi> Lend or cauſe to be lent by way of Advance, any Money upon the Branches of the King's Revenue ariſing by Cuſtoms, Exciſe or Hearth-Money, <hi>(that is, all the principal Branches)</hi> ſhall be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to hinder the Sitting of Parliaments, and ſhall be reſponſible for the ſame in Parliament.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Firſt they Reſolve they would give nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then they terrify all others as much as in them lyeth from <hi>Lending or Advancing</hi> any Money to him; which was not according to their Writ of Election to Adviſe his Majeſty, but by dureſs to force and compel him to Submit to their better Judgment as became Loyal and Dutiful Subjects.</p>

                     <p>So that his Majeſty might well ſay of theſe <hi>Votes,</hi> That inſtead of giving him aſsiſtance to Support his Allies, or enabling him to Preſerve <hi>Tangier,</hi> they tended rather to diſable him from contributing towards either, by his own <hi>Revenue</hi> or <hi>Credit,</hi> not only expoſing him to all Dangers that might happen either at home or abroad; but endeavouring to deprive him of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Supporting the Government it Self, and to reduce him to a more helpleſs condition than the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Subjects. A <hi>Sad</hi> and a very <hi>Juſt Complaint,</hi> and Accordingly reſented by that vaſt Number of People that have ſince <hi>Addreſsed</hi> to thank his Majeſty for that <hi>Declaration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>January.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lords ſent a Meſſage to the Commons to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them that their Lordſhips had appointed that day Sevennight for hearing the Cauſe upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> and that their Houſe might reply if they thought fit, but they had no leiſure to take notice of it.</p>

                     <p>The ſame day they <hi>Ordered,</hi> That a <hi>Committee</hi> ſhould be Appointed to inſpect the Journals of their Houſe, and of the Houſe of Lords, and <hi>Precedents,</hi> to Juſtify and Maintain, <hi>That the Lords ought to Commit Perſons to Safe Cuſtody when Impeached for High Treaſon by the Commons in Parliament, and to make report thereof to the Houſe.</hi> Which <hi>Vote</hi> had relation to Sir <hi>William Scroggs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo we are come to the day that finally put an End to all their Proceedings, which was <hi>Munday</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> day of <hi>January;</hi> and a great Wonder it was that his Majeſty could endure them ſo long.</p>
                     <p>They began the day with a <hi>Vote,</hi> which ſhews the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Tendance of all the reſt.</p>

                     <p>They Knew then that they were to be Prorogued, but they Knew not by whoſe Advice; and ſo if his Majeſty did it without any Advice, then all theſe Hard words were thrown at him: but by whomſoever it were done, this <hi>Vote</hi> could have no good meaning or effect, and muſt end in Smoke or Tumults; and Confuſion.</p>

                        <p>Reſolved, That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, That the

                     <p>This was excellently timed, and they had ſo obliged his Majeſty, they might be ſure he would not deny them.</p>
                     <q>Reſolved, That it is the Opinion of this Houſe, That the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws, is at this time Grievous to the Subject, a weakning of the Proteſtant Intereſt, and incouragement to Popery, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.</q>
                     <p>Here their Mouths were ſtopt by a Meſſage from the King, by <hi>Edward Carteret</hi> Uſher of the <hi>Black-Rod,</hi> Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that the King Commanded them to Attend him immediately in the Houſe of Peers.

                     <p>There was another <hi>Act</hi> for Repeal of the <hi>Act</hi> of the 35 of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ready to be paſſed, and it was Loſt No body knew how, and was never tendred to his Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this Parliament was Diſſolved by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the great Satisfaction of all but the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> who (if they had been able to conſider things Aright) had as little reaſon to be pleaſed with their Proceedings as any of the reſt; for they did them no other Service then to Exaſperate the King and the Government againſt them and have made them to be more proſecuted and leſs pitied than they were before.</p>
                     <p>The Popiſh Party received almoſt as little damage by them as the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> did Advantage; for they bending their force Equally againſt the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> all their <hi>Deſigns</hi> (if they had any beyond clamour) againſt the <hi>Papists</hi> were broken.</p>
                     <p>Their Arbitrary and Illegal Proceedings againſt the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrers</hi> of the <hi>Tumultuous Petitions for the Sitting of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> procured more Friends to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> then perhaps he would otherwiſe have had, and gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry an Excellent Proſpect what they might Expect from theſe <hi>Warm Gentlemen</hi> if ever they fell into their hands.</p>
                     <p>The King had a fair Warning alſo to look to Himſelf, and the <hi>Religion by Law Eſtabliſhed,</hi> when he ſaw with how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reverence theſe <hi>Proteſtants at Large</hi> treated him, while his <hi>Prerogatives</hi> were intire, and wholly in his Own Hands; and had he but yielded to them in the Point of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> they would Soon have taught him, how little was to be gotten by Complying with men of their temper.</p>
                     <p>The only Service they did was to the <hi>French</hi> King: for our Allies beyond Seas ſeeing that No Aſſiſtance was to be Expected from <hi>England,</hi> Surrendred their ſtrongeſt Towns
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56751:131"/>to him for the Asking, and ſo ſuffered the worſt effects of War in Peace.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> Loſt the hopes of having any more Parliaments amongſt them till Times be better and more Settled, by their grateful Applications to them for their Loyalty and Care of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion at Large.</hi>

                     <p>The Trade of a Conſiderable part of the Nation is ruined, not for want of Laws, but by too many, which have reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that intercourſe and freedom that ought to be betwixt Us and our Neighbour Nations: yet I cannot ſay that this Parliament would have relieved the Nation in that point if they had Continued Longer, when it is conſidered with what care and induſtry the <hi>Act</hi> for the prohibition of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cattel was carried againſt all oppoſition, tho it is damage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a very conſiderable part of the Nation, if not to the whole; and had theſe Gentlemen been equally concerned for the Suppreſsing of Popery, as they were for this <hi>ACT;</hi> Some of thoſe Bills at leaſt, that were ſent down from the Lords, or began by the Commons, might have been ready as well as this for the Royal Aſſent.</p>
                     <p>Yet they had ſome very good Bills relating to Trade under conſideration, but they were not ſo Zealous in that Concern as they ought to have been: but rather ſeemed to fear the State of the People on that account ſhould be made too eaſie before they had obtained their other Ends of his Majeſty and the Government,</p>
                     <p>Of this their <hi>Vote</hi> about the <hi>Act</hi> for prohibition of the <hi>French</hi> Trade may be an inſtance; for however that <hi>Act</hi> might be of great uſe, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> would conſent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all Trade with them as well as We: yet as Long as they go on to Trade with them, and we do not, it onely tends to impoveriſh the King and Us; and Inrich them; and therefore ought to have been left at liberty till they and we can mutually agree to ſtop it.</p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:56751:131"/>
                     <p>Nor did the <hi>Proteſtant Religion by Law eſtabliſhed,</hi> fare any better, for that being equally oppoſed by the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> on one hand, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> on the other, under pretence of Uniting us againſt the latter, the former were encouraged by their Votes and Bills to endeavour her ruine.</p>
                     <p>The Bill for Uniting his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, is a perfect Toleration of almoſt all other Religions which are or ſhall be amongſt us, except Popery; and had it, and the other Bill for Exempting them from the Penalties of the Laws made againſt the Popiſh Recuſants paſſed, it would not have been poſſible to have Executed them or any other againſt the Papiſts. For it cannot be imagined that the Papiſts could not have been able to have got themſelves Liſted amongſt ſome of our Diſſenters or other, and then upon making the Declaration, and producing two Perſons as Witneſs, that they believed them to be Proteſtant Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they would have had the liberty to have inflamed both thoſe Diſſenters that were Comprehended, and thoſe that were Tolerated againſt the entire Conformiſts, and theſe again againſt them. And ſo both Popery ſhould have gone unpuniſhed, and the Feuds amongſt our ſelves would have grown to that height, that nothing but a ſtanding Army would have been able to have kept us in any tolerable quiet.</p>
                     <p>If the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had been part of them entire Conformiſts, and part of them Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, thoſe that were of the firſt ſort, would have kept up the Religion Eſtabliſhed as high or higher then now, and the other Party muſt have laid aſide totally the uſe of the Common-Prayer as well as the Surplice, Croſs, and Kneeling at the Lords Supper, or elſe their whole Party which now follow them, would have all left them, and ſo another Faction would have riſen in the Church of Semi-Conformiſts, and all thoſe that are without the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56751:132"/>Church would have continued, as now they are, under other Teachers, only more inſolent, and more turbulent; and ſo inſtead of uniting us againſt the Papiſts and Popery, which is the pretended cauſe of the <hi>Act,</hi> we ſhould have been more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and Animated againſt each other then now we are.</p>
                     <p>It was one of the Rules preſcribed by that Bill, <hi>That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be admitted to take the Declaration, who refuſed the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy when tendred unto him.</hi> Now this would have left all the Quakers, Anabaptiſts, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Sects in the ſame ſtate of Perſecution (as they call it) as they now are; and great Numbers of the Other Sects too, when they had conſidered of it, would have Scrupled it, as well as they in <hi>Scotland</hi> have done: and ſo thoſe that were totally Excluded, would have been enraged againſt thoſe that had been tolerated, as having betrayed them firſt, and then left them to the <hi>Severity</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and by that time all theſe Parties, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rigid Conformiſts.</hi> 2. <hi>Semi-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi> 3. <hi>Tolerated,</hi> and <hi>Non-Tolerated Proteſtants,</hi> all enraged againſt each other, had for ſome time been fermented by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Party, a man may gueſs what kind of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> there would have been amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when they had gained all this, what Security could have been given that they would have reſted here? that <hi>Act</hi> which one Parliament makes, another may Repeal: and they would never have been Secure of Keeping what they had gained, but by taking care to fill the Houſe of Commons in every Parliament with the moſt Factious men they could pick out; and they could never have maintained their reputation with the Party, but by puſhing things forward, and ſo every Seſſions ſomething more muſt have been granted for the better Security of the Union, and removing of Fears and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, till at laſt we had been brought to the ſame ſtate of Confuſion his Majeſty found us in at his Return.</p>
                     <p>That a conſiderable number of theſe <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are as much
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56751:132"/>againſt Monarchy as Conformity, is Apparent by their Books, diſcourſes, and former practice. Now what Security ſhould his Majeſty have had, that when this Party had by impunity and time been ſtrong enough to have dealt with the Loyal Party, they would not have endeavoured to be diſpenſed with from obeying him or any other King but <hi>Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> and then Nothing could have united Proteſtants and Secured us againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> but the Laying aſide the Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Setting up a Common-wealth; and of this they have already given ſome Notable hints in their Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets: and when they are told the Excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> will onely Secure them once from a Popiſh Prince, and make them that follow more Cautious how they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves too ſoon; and that if any Actual King of <hi>England</hi> ſhould turn Papiſt, which is as poſſible and more probable then that another Heir ſhould do it, they would then be in the ſame ſtate as if the Duke Succeeded: They conſtantly reply, <hi>That it is unreaſonable it ſhould be in the power of one man to reduce us to Popery;</hi> that is, It is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that Kingly Government ſhould be any Longer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued amongſt us.</p>
                     <p>From all which I conclude, That the project of Uniting Proteſtants by remitting the Laws againſt the Diſſenters, is impoſsible; and that theſe Conſequences being Obvious and Apparent before-hand; there could be no other deſign in the Attempt but the ruine of the Monarchy, and the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Confuſion, and War amongſt us; at leaſt theſe would certainly have followed.</p>
                     <p>So that the day a <hi>Toleration,</hi> or which is all one, an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> amongſt Proteſtants upon the terms propounded, is ſettled, the Monarchy muſt be made Abſolute, or it will not Stand: And Proviſion muſt be made to maintain a Standing Army bigg enough eo <hi>Keep all Parties Quiet,</hi> how much ſoever they are averſe to it, or our <hi>Peace</hi> at home will not be Maintained
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56751:133"/>And as to all Foreign affairs, <hi>England</hi> muſt look on, and ſuffer all things to go as they will; for Neither King nor Common-Wealth will be in a Condition to do any thing abroad in that unſettled ſtate things will be at home; and by that time <hi>England</hi> comes to ſettle, <hi>France</hi> (if God interpoſe not by Miracles) will have brought under So many of its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that <hi>England</hi> will be able to make no effectual reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance if it ſhould be attacked by that Potent Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>I have laid the Matter plainly before you, not Knowing what may follow as to my Self; but this I am ſure of, that Advantage I can have none by it. I am a private perſon, and I Expect ſo to live and die. I have no aim at any Publick Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or Place of Truſt, nor any means to attain it if I had: I am Contented with the State God hath Set me In. And the Utmoſt I wiſh for is; to Leave things to my Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as they ought Now to be, if the Laws had their due Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and therefore I am compelled by Nothing but my Zealous affection for my Country, which (next God and my own Soul) I love above all things, to run the hazard of giving you this Advice, and thereby drawing upon me the Malice and Revenge of all thoſe that ſeek to Ruine and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave You.</p>
                     <p>As to thoſe <hi>Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons,</hi> who may poſſibly take offence at What I have written, (for all I am
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56751:133"/>ſure will not) I deſire they would in cool blood Conſider what they have done, and then let them think of Me what they pleaſe: For if ever Faction, Anger, and ill deſigns were entertained by ſo great a Body of Men as the Major part of this Houſe was, it is Apparent they were here. And I will inſtance in but a few Particulars, tho I might in more.</p>
                     <p>Can any mortal man produce either Precedent or Law to Juſtifie the Impriſonment of the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> called the <hi>Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers?</hi> Have the meaneſt people of <hi>England</hi> a right to Petition the King againſt his Expreſs Command, in a thing of which he is the Sole Judge, by all our Laws; and that by Multitudes of Hands procured by men that have no authority for that purpoſe; and may not Grand-Juries, Juſtices of the Peace, and other ſuch like perſons oppoſe them, or which is leſs, diſown it? But ſuppoſe they did more than they ought, was it fit to impriſon them before they were allowed to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> it ſerved your turn now, but it may one day be turn'd againſt you, and then conſider how you will take it. The Corporations do Now moſt of them ſend <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> but they may when they pleaſe lay You by; and ſend Mechanicks, Trades-men, Shop-Keepers, How would your high ſpirits brook it to be ſent for in Cuſtody, and made to Kneel (without being Suffered to Speak, and onely for doing your duties) to ſuch men, and ſo be ſent home again? I am ſure no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman can brook this indignity but with ſuch inward Reſentments as befit the Generoſity and Temper of that Nation, or otherwiſe I muſt think we are prepared for Slavery; and all that Manly Courage that hath made our People Renowned in all Countries in the World, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into the Moſt Shameful Effeminacy and Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Onely in this caſe Religion and Loyalty made them yield, even to Injuſtice and Oppreſsion. As long as his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty thought fit to Suffer it, they Submitted, but with ſuch Thoughts as would have taught you more Juſtice and Moderation, if this had not been in the caſe.</p>

                     <p>Your ſtyling all thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that had been brought in to the Commiſsion of the Peace in the room of ſome others diſplaced, <hi>MEN of Arbitrary Principles, and Countenancers of Papiſts and Popery;</hi> and if you could have invented more Odious Names and Words than theſe, you might with as much truth and ingenuity have beſtowed them upon them. Was it fairly done, or was it not? Is it one of the Priviledges of your Houſe to <hi>Vote Me a Jew or a Turk,</hi> or that I was one of thoſe men that occaſioned the Breach betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt and his Parliament? If it be, then I will ſay no more, but that I begg your Pardon; and Kneel down at the Bar of a <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> with the ſame Submiſsion, as if I believed the <hi>Speaker</hi> Infallible, and every Member an Angel. But if your <hi>Votes</hi> ought to be not only Conſonant to Law, but agreeable to the truth of things, then that Paſſage was haſtily and paſsionately written, and not well Conſidered; and care ought to be taken for the future to <hi>Write</hi> more Cautiouſly, and <hi>Speak</hi> and <hi>Vote</hi> like Men that had a little reſpect to your Places.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1680. concerning his Majeſties Revenues and borrowing of Money upon them, are they juſtifiable or no? may I not lend the King 100 <hi>l.</hi> if I pleaſe without your leave, and not incur the danger of being reputed an Enemy to the Sitting of Parliaments? Suppoſe the <hi>French</hi> ſhould Land in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or the Papiſts or Diſſenters riſe, and the King Want Money to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the one, or drive out the other, muſt we hazard his and our Ruine, rather then ſupply him by a Lone in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of Parliament, have we a Property in what is our own, and may we not uſe it as we ſee cauſe, without breach of Priviledge of Parliament?</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Vote</hi> of the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>January, That the Proſecution of the Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws, was at that time Grievous to the Subject, a Weakning of the Proteſtant Intereſt,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56751:134"/>an Incouragement to Popery, and Dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom;</hi> is as little underſtood as any of the reſt. Why was it made? To what Subject is it Grievous? To the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters? Why then let them leave their Diſſenting to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and all will be well. What Proteſtant Intereſt doth it weaken, for there are more Proteſtant Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts then one in the Nation? doth it weaken that Proteſtant Intereſt which is Settled by Law? Then ſay ſo. But how it doth encourage <hi>Popery,</hi> or endanger the <hi>Peace of the Nation,</hi> is yet Harder to be underſtood: but Suppoſe it did; what then? You may repeal the Laws, and Bills you had afoot, that would have Repealed them if they would have paſſed; but you were to be adjourned, and had not time to finiſh them: And did you think to have laid them aſleep by your <hi>Single Vote,</hi> without the Conſent of the Lords or the King? You ſhould have done well then to have told the Nation that you have the whole Legiſlative Power in your hands, and that it is Contrary to Law for any man to Act againſt a <hi>Vote</hi> of the Houſe of Commons, tho in Obedience to an Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>But that I may not ſeem to ſet up my own Single Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a <hi>Whole Houſe of Commons,</hi> I will inſert an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or two Equal to them, in better Times tho they be Long.

                           </p>

                           <p>And on the Contrary, That the Aſſerting of the Laws and the Religion Eſtabliſhed according to the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Uniformity,</hi> is the moſt probable Means to produce a Settled Peace and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience through the Kingdom; becauſe the Variety of Profeſſions in Religion, when Openly indulged, doth directly diſtinguiſh men into Parties, and withal gives them Opportunities to count their Numbers, which conſidering the Animoſities that out of a religious Pride will be kept on foot by the ſeveral Factions, doth tend directly and inevitably to open diſturbance: Nor can Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty have any Security, that the Doctrine or Worſhip of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Factions, which are all governed by a Several Rule, ſhall be conſiſtent with the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>

                           <p>And if any perſon ſhall preſume to diſturb the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, We do in all humility declare, That we will for ever, and upon all occaſions be ready with our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmoſt Endeavours and Aſsiſtance, to Adhere to, and Serve Your Majesty according to our bounden Duty and Allegiance.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The Reaſon and Loyalty of this</hi> Addreſs <hi>prevailed with his Majeſty at that time, to lay aſide all his Thoughts of an</hi> Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; <hi>and well had it been for him and us, if he had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed them: for from his forſaking this Advice in the Year 1671. Sprung all thoſe Miſeries that now ſo much threaten him and us. But tho his Majeſty Changed, the</hi> Parliament <hi>kept their grounds; for in an</hi> Addreſs <hi>dated the</hi> 14th <hi>of</hi> Feb. <hi>1672. they aſſert againſt</hi> His Majeſties Declaration of Indulgence <hi>dated the</hi> 15th <hi>of</hi> March <hi>before,</hi> That <hi>Penal Statutes</hi> in Matters Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, cannot be ſuſpended but by Act of Parliament. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(ſay they)</hi> the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons, do moſt humbly beſeech Your Majeſty, That the ſaid Lawes may have their Free Courſe, until it ſhall be otherwiſe provided by Act of Parliament; and that Your Majeſty would Graciouſly be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give ſuch Directions herein, that no Apprehenſions or Jea ouſies may remain in the Hearts of Your Majeſties good and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The King not being Satisfied with this, but ſtill inſiſting that he had a Right by his Supremacy to Suſpend the Execution of</hi> Penal Laws in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs; <hi>They replyed the</hi> 26th <hi>of</hi> Feb. <hi>following,</hi> That no ſuch Power was ever Claimed or Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by any of his Majeſties Predeceſſors; and if it ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, might tend to the Interrupting of the Free Courſe of the Laws, and altering the <hi>Legiſlative Power,</hi> which hath always been acknowledged to reſide in his Majeſty, and the Two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Therefore they did with an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimous Conſent become again Humble Suitors unto his Sacred Majesty, That he would be pleaſed to give them a full and Satisfactory Anſwer to their firſt <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Addreſs;</hi> and that his Majeſty would take ſuch effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Order, That the Proceedings in this Matter might not be for the future drawn into Example.</p>

                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:56751:137"/>
                     <p>To which ſaid laſt <hi>Addreſs,</hi> his Majeſty was pleaſed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend ſo far, as to Order his <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence</hi> to be taken off the File and Cancell'd.</p>
                     <p>Now the uſe I make of all, is to ſhew firſt, That the Opinion of an Excellent &amp; Wiſe Houſe of Commons was, That an <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Toleration</hi> or <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> as they now call it, was of a <hi>Miſchievous Nature,</hi> and would finally end in <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That if it ſhould be thought neceſſary to grant one, it being a <hi>Legiſlative Act,</hi> it muſt be by the Joynt Conſent of the King and the Two Houſes, and not by any one of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will Leave it to the Conſideration of the Gentlemen of that Houſe to Judge, Whether they did well in paſſing the <hi>Vote</hi> of the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> aforeſaid, for <hi>the Suſpenſion of all Penal Laws which relate to the Proteſtant Diſſenters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some pretending to Excuſe them, have ſaid it was a <hi>Vote</hi> only in order to a Bill to be brought in for the taking thoſe Laws away. But I anſwer, There were ſeveral other Bills for that purpoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; and therefore this was in vain. Secondly, There is no mention of a Bill to be brought in in the Concluſion of the <hi>Vote.</hi> Thirdly, They knew they were to be <hi>Prorogued,</hi> as appears by their firſt <hi>Vote,</hi> and therefore Such a <hi>Deſign</hi> would have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Now if they had carried thoſe few Points in this Seſsion, <hi>Firſt</hi> not onely to <hi>Deny</hi> the King any Supply, but to make it Criminal for any man to <hi>Lend</hi> him any Money upon his Revenues; they might then in another Seſsion have gone further, and have made it Puniſhable for any man to have paid him his Juſt Settled, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Dues; and that would have made them able to have <hi>Forced</hi> this <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to <hi>what ever</hi> they had pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If they might have gone on to impriſon his Majeſty's Subjects in an <hi>Illegal</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way, for Matters that had no relation to Priviledges of Parliament, they might afterwards have <hi>Extended</hi> this to as many Perſons and Things as they had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo No man would have <hi>dared</hi> to have ſtood by His <hi>Majeſty</hi> againſt a <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> tho they had attempted to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56751:137"/>
                        <hi>Depoſe</hi> his <hi>Majeſty.</hi> Nor would his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in a ſhort time have been able to have Protected his Subjects againſt any injury that they or any of them had been pleaſed to have done them; which would infallibly have Subverted the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> and have introduced a <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If they had got that great Branch of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative</hi> Power into their hands, of ſuſpending the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws by their <hi>Vote,</hi> they might have driven it as far as they pleaſed, and ſo have once more <hi>Outed</hi> the King and the Houſe of Lords, as a former Parliament did by the Same Means. I will conclude this with the Judgment of a Great and a Learned Man.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>No Orders made by A Houſe of Commons in</hi> England, <hi>are of any Validity or Force, or receive any Submiſsion, longer then that Houſe of Commons Continues; and if Any Order made by them be againſt any</hi> Law <hi>or</hi> Statute, <hi>it is Void when it is Made, and receives no Obedience.</hi>

                        <p>BEing Inform'd that you are upon a Continuation of that Excellent Work, Entituled, <hi>An Addreſs to the Freemen and Freeholders of the Nation;</hi> and that the Third Part of it is now in the Preſs, we take the Freedom to Trouble you with this our Joynt-Requeſt: That if you take any Notice of the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Richard Thompſon</hi> of <hi>Briſtol</hi> Clerk, in the Series of your Narration, you will be pleaſed to give Credit to the Report which we ſhall here offer you; And (if you think fitting) to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to the Publick in his Juſtification and Defence. The Particulars hereof we have partly upon very Good Authority; And we are able to Teſtifie the Truth of the reſt upon our own Knowledge and Experience as to the Character, Life, and Converſation of This Worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
                        <p>He was Born of Proteſtant Parents, and Educated in the Methods and Principles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He received his Orders of Prieſthood from the Hands of Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in the year 1670. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon this Qualification, he was ſent by the Reverend Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> to ſerve in his Cure of <hi>Brington</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire;</hi> where he continued ſome Years with a very Fair Reputation.</p>
                        <p>About the year 1675. He removed from thence to <hi>Salisbury</hi> upon the Invitation of the ſaid Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Sarum,</hi> where he liv'd with him in his own Houſe.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1676. The Dean beſtow'd upon him firſt a Prebend; And then a Preſentation to St. <hi>Marie</hi>'s in <hi>Marlborough.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1677. He Travail'd with Mr. <hi>Jo. Norborne</hi> of <hi>Calne</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire;</hi> but within leſs than a Twelvemonth he was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56751:139"/>Recall'd, upon the Vacancy of <hi>Bedminſter</hi> by <hi>Briſtol</hi> his Preſent Living.</p>
                        <p>When he was abroad, he neither Studyed at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> nor <hi>Douay,</hi> (as was ſuggeſted:) Nor ever ſaw thoſe Places, nor paſs'd into any part of <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> but <hi>France</hi> alone.</p>
                        <p>He ſpent near Seven Months of his time at <hi>Paris;</hi> and in the Academy of Monſieur <hi>Fonbert,</hi> a Proteſtant, ſtill frequenting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador's Chappel, and receiving the Sacrament there: And during his ſtay he Preach'd twice, and read Prayers often in That Chappel.</p>
                        <p>At <hi>Guien</hi> upon the <hi>Loyre,</hi> he ſojourn'd all his time there with Monſieur <hi>Du Paizy</hi> the Proteſtant Miniſter, Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtant Church, and that only; Receiving the Sacrament alſo from the hands of Monſieur <hi>Du Paizy,</hi> to put thoſe Men out of hope of Gaining him over that had already Sollicited him by fair Promiſes of Advantage to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At <hi>Blois</hi> he kept himſelf alſo upon the ſame Reſerve, avoiding even to Lodge in the Houſe of a Romaniſt, but upon Abſolute Neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>He was not yet ſo Rigorous as not to allow himſelf in a Curioſity to make an Acquaintance as well with Perſons Eminent in their ſeveral Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as with the Famous Men of the Proteſtant Churches.</p>
                        <p>He does not deny but that he had twice or thrice ſeen Maſs performed while he was abroad, but it was Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, not Religion that carried him thither: And that he is ſo far from being ſtagger'd in his Faith by any thing he ſaw abroad, that he is the more Confirm'd in it. And that he would rather Beg within the Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than be the greateſt Perſon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could make him out of it,</p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:56751:140"/>
                        <p>Since his Return in 1678. No man hath kept himſelf more ſtrictly to the Orders of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He hath taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy at leaſt Eight ſeveral times; Preaching and Acting in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity thereunto. He never Refus'd any Teſt of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Government, and Declares himſelf Ready to take any farther Teſts that ſhall be lawfully impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
